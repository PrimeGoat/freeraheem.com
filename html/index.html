					<p class="center">THIS IS A PERSECUTION (NOT A PROSECUTION)</p>

					<p>JUDGE LEWIS A. KAPLAN GOOGLED RAHEEM BRENNERMAN THEN DEPRIVED HIM EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAW</p>
					<ul class="justify">
						<li>From the outset this prosecution was racially motivated and wrong. Brennerman faces racial injustice with his wrongful prosecution and false imprisonment following U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan ("Judge Kaplan") ignoring the federal rule to Google him then depriving him of the equal protection of the law upon realizing that he is a black man to convict and imprison him for criminal contempt of court even though Brennerman was not a party to the underlying civil case between ICBC (London) plc and The Blacksands Pacific Group, Inc. (The Second Circuit Federal Manhattan Appeals Court in "OSRecovery, Inc., v. One Groupe, Int`l, Inc., 462 F.3d 87, 90 (2d Cir. 2006)" previously stated directly to Judge Kaplan that he could not hold a non-party in contempt)</li>
						<li>Judge Kaplan ignored the law to hold Brennerman in contempt then persuaded the Manhattan prosecutors (Assistant United States Attorneys Nicolas Landsman-Roos and Robert Benjamin Sobelman together with their investigator Justin Ellard) to arrest Brennerman and prosecute him criminally even though the law clearly says that the Judge cannot do this to someone who was/is not part of the case. The Manhattan prosecutors, without considering the law, then arrested Brennerman at his home even though there was/were no pending charges against him and no order had been made by the Court to include him in the underlying civil case.</li>
						<li>During trial, Judge Kaplan denied Brennerman`s request for evidence from ICBC (London) plc which he required to defend himself while allowing the Manhattan prosecutors to present to the jury that Judge Kaplan already held Brennerman in contempt, even though that order of contempt by Judge Kaplan was adjudged in contrast with the law. A juror named Gordon stated that the contempt adjudged by Judge Kaplan against Brennerman swayed the jury to find Brennerman guilty of criminal contempt of court (see 1:17-CR-337-RJS, doc. no. 236, Exhibit 3).</li>
						<li>The Second Circuit Manhattan Federal Appeals Court then refused to correct their erroneous decision creating disparity between Brennerman and their prior decision regarding adjudging contempt against non-parties. It also created disparity with the Supreme Court decision that criminal defendants have constitutional right to present a complete defense.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>JUDGE RICHARD J. SULLIVAN AND THE MANHATTAN PROSECUTORS MISREPRESENTED FACTS AND EVIDENCE THEN IGNORED THE LAW TO WRONGLY CONVICT AND IMPRISON RAHEEM BRENNERMAN</p>
					<ul class="justify">
						<li>Within six weeks of Judge Kaplan referring Brennerman to the Manhattan prosecutors seeking for him to be prosecuted criminally, the Manhattan prosecutors in addition to charging Brennerman for criminal contempt of court also indicted him for fraud, announcing an indictment for "$300 MILLION INTERNATIONAL FRAUD" even though there was no investigation that preceded the indictment.</li>
					</ul>

						<div class="plusMinus"><b>[ + ]</b></div> <u>BANK FRAUD CASE:</u>
					</div>
					<div class="collapsible">
						<ul class="justify">
							<li>Manhattan prosecutors argued that bank fraud occurred based on an account Brennerman opened for a few weeks with an institution, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC which is not a bank. Brennerman deposited his own money and did not ask for any loan and did not receive any money. The prosecutors pivoted and the Judge argued that Brennerman received "perks" worth $6,000 such as sky miles and fancy credit card, even though the credit card was closed with zero balance and Brennerman did not have the account open long enough to even earn any sky miles. The law says that prosecutors cannot prosecute bank fraud unless the account is with an institution which is FDIC insured, however the Court and prosecutors ignored the law. In fact, when Brennerman highlighted it to the judge he just ignored Brennerman.</li>
							<li>Judge Richard J. Sullivan then engaged in a surreptitious endeavor to falsely satisfy the FDIC essential element necessary to convict Brennerman for bank fraud and bank fraud conspiracy by improperly supplanting a non-FDIC insured institution, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC "MSSB" (which Government presented as Government Exhibit - GX1-57; GX1-57A; GX529; GX1-73, during trial as evidence of Brennerman`s interaction with Morgan Stanley (see 1:17-CR-337-RJS, doc. no. 167)) with a FDIC insured institution, Morgan Stanley Private Bank "MSPB" (even though Government presented no evidence of Brennerman`s interaction with MSPB (see 1:17-CR-337-RJS, doc. no 206), in an endeavor to wrongly convict and imprison Brennerman.</li>
							<li>On appeal, the Second Circuit Federal Manhattan Court ("Second Circuit") ignored trial testimony from Government witnesses, Barry Gonzalez and Kevin Bonebrake, who testified that Morgan Stanley & Co, LLC is not FDIC-insured and operates through various subsidiaries; that Brennerman opened his wealth management account with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC, a non-FDIC insured subsidiary of Morgan Stanley & Co, LLC; and that each subsidiary requires its own FDIC certificate as the FDIC certificate of one subsidiary does not cover another subsidiary or the parent company (see 1:17-CR-337-RJS, trial transcripts 384-385; 387-388; 409; 1057-1061). Instead the Second Circuit generalized by stating that Brennerman defrauded "Morgan Stanley, an FDIC insured institution" without considering the trial records. The Second Circuit also stated incorrectly that the bank fraud was about a single phone call which Brennerman had with Kevin Bonebrake about oil asset financing without acknowledging trial testimony where Mr. Bonebrake told the Court that the call was "very preliminary discussion" and that the company where he worked was not expected to provide any money but instead expected to help raise financing from investors. Here as well, the law says that the prosecutors cannot prosecute Brennerman unless his phone call was with someone that worked for a bank. Kevin Bonebrake worked for another non-FDIC insured subsidiary of Morgan Stanley. The Court and prosecutors ignored the law.</li>

						<div class="plusMinus"><b>[ + ]</b></div> <u>WIRE FRAUD CASE:</u>
					</div>
					<div class="collapsible">
						<ul class="justify">
							<li>Prior to trial for the fraud case, Brennerman requested for evidence of the fraud however the Manhattan prosecutors advised him that they were not obligated to obtain the evidence (the complete ICBC underwriting files) from the bank (ICBC (London) plc which is based in London, United Kingdom. In-fact to-date while Brennerman is imprisoned the Manhattan prosecutors have never obtained or reviewed the evidence.</li>
							<li>Prior to trial for the fraud case, Brennerman argued to the Court (Judge Richard J. Sullivan) that he would not be able to defend himself without the evidence (the ICBC underwriting file) however Judge Sullivan ignored him and allowed the Government witness, Julian Madgett from ICBC (London) plc to testify even though the Judge knew that Brennerman would not be able to confront the witness or present a complete defense. The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution states that every criminal defendant has the right to obtain evidence in their favor and shall have the ability to confront witness against them, however the Judge who had an obligation to protect Brennerman`s Constitutional rights failed to do so and Brennerman was not able to effectively cross examine the witness.</li>
							<li>During trial the Government presented their sole witness, Julian Madgett from ICBC (London) plc to testify as to the contents of the underwriting file without ever obtaining or reviewing it themselves. The ICBC (London) plc underwriting file documents the basis for approving the bridge finance and thus highlights the representations or alleged misrepresentations that were "Material" (an essential element of the charged crime) to the approval of the bridge loan. Without the Government independently obtaining or reviewing the underwriting file, the entire case/prosecution is based solely on the uncorroborated testimony of Julian Madgett from ICBC (London) plc.  This is a violation of Brennerman`s Due Process right. More importantly, Brennerman was deprived of the ability to use the ICBC underwriting file to challenge the testimony of Julian Madgett or to present a complete defense as stipulated by the Sixth Amendment. The ICBC (London) plc underwriting file will show that ICBC (London) plc did not rely on any representations by Brennerman in its approval of the bridge finance because they relied on other information not presented at trial.</li>
							<li>During trial, Government sole witness from ICBC (London) plc, Julian Madgett testified (at 1:17-CR-377-RJS, trial transcript 551-554) that evidence exists, ICBC underwriting file which documents the basis for the bank approving the bridge finance and that Government never obtained or reviewed the evidence.  Brennerman immediately through defense counsel, Thompson Hine LLP filed motion (at 1:17-CR-337-RJS, doc. no. 71) to request that Judge Sullivan compel the Government to obtain the ICBC underwriting file and/or subpoena ICBC (London) plc to present the ICBC underwriting file to Brennerman, for his defense however Judge Sullivan denied the request stating (at 1:17-CR-337-RJS, trial transcript 617) that the witness, Julian Madgett had testified that the ICBC underwriting file was with the bank`s file in London, United Kingdom and that the witness testified that he had not reviewed it in preparation for his testimony.</li>
							<li>On appeal, the Second Circuit Manhattan Federal Appeals Court ignored the trial records and stated incorrectly that the evidence, ICBC underwriting file, which Brennerman requested/required to defend himself did not exist beyond Brennerman`s bare assertion and thus the Government had met its disclosure obligations, however trial record (at 1:17-CR-337-RJS, trial transcript 551-554) clearly shows that Government witness, Julian Madgett testified and confirmed that the evidence exists with the bank in London, United Kingdom and trial record (at 1:17-CR-337-RJS, trial transcript 617) clearly demonstrates Judge Sullivan acknowledging that the witness, Julian Madgett had testified to the existence of the evidence, ICBC underwriting file with the bank`s file in London, U.K., therefore the Second Circuit Court disposition was erroneous.</li>
							<li>After trial, Brennerman in an endeavor to obtain the ICBC underwriting file and other evidence (which Government failed to present to the jury at trial including his birth certificate) so as to prepare comprehensive post-trial motions, requested for the evidence (at 1:17-CR-337-RJS, doc. nos. 153, 161, 187, 200, 236, 240, 241, 248, 250, correspondence of January 22, 2021 and February 2, 2021 which remains un-docketed) however Judge Sullivan has continued to deny Brennerman`s request.</li>
						</ul>
					</div><br>
					<!-- Collapse end -->

					<ul class="justify">
						<li>In December 2020, Brennerman submitted to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ("Manhattan Federal Appeals Court") (at 18-3546, doc. nos. 211, 217 for the fraud case and at 18-1033, doc. no 334) evidence of the erroneous disposition to allow the Second Circuit Court to correct its errors. However to-date the Manhattan Federal Appeals Court refuses to correct its error to free an innocent black man.</li>
						<li>On January 22, 2021 and February 2, 2021, Brennerman submitted motion with evidence to Judge Richard J. Sullivan highlighting among others that Judge Richard J. Sullivan had misrepresented evidence in a surreptitious endeavor to convict and imprison him by improperly supplanting evidence of a non-FDIC insured institution with a FDIC insured institution. However Judge Sullivan refused to place the motion (with evidence) on the Court docket.</li>
						<li>This entire prosecution was initiated at the behest of Judge Lewis A. Kaplan following Judge Kaplan Googling Brennerman and realizing that Brennerman is a black man and the Chairman and CEO for The Blacksands Pacific Group, Inc.</li>
						<li>Then, without any investigation and evidence of the alleged crime, the prosecutors pursued racism and xenophobia by concocting a story for the public. First, distorting Brennerman`s name, race, nationality and educational background, all in an endeavor to support their false narrative.</li>
						<li>When the trial evidence did not support their narrative, Judge Sullivan misrepresented the evidence to falsely satisfy the FDIC essential element necessary to convict for bank fraud while intentionally depriving Brennerman access to the evidence which will demonstrate that there was no fraud.</li>
						<li>To-date while Brennerman has continued to request for copy of his birth certificate and Passports which are in Government`s possession so as to refute the false narrative and story by the Government, both Judge Sullivan and the Manhattan prosecutors have continued to ignore his request.</li>

					<h2>CAMPAIGN AGAINST RACIAL INJUSTICE</h2>
					<h3>FREE RAHEEM J BRENNERMAN</h3>
					<p>Please call on U.S. Congress to act and investigate the Judicial misconduct, Violation of Due Process, Violation of civil and Constitutional rights. Racial bias and overall mistreatment of businessman Raheem Jefferson Brennerman</p>
					<p>Please call on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to recall the Mandate for both the criminal contempt of court appeal at appeal docket no. 18-1033(L) and the fraud case appeal at appeal docket no. 18-3546(L) to allow the panel Court reconsider and amend their erroneous decision</p>
					<p>The Manhattan U.S. Attorney Office deliberately refused to obtain, review or present the evidence (pertinent ICBC (London) plc underwriting files and negotiation records) to prove their false prosecution for contempt and fraud so they pivoted to lie and distort the truth about my name, race, nationality, education and character among others in an endeavor to promote their racism and xenophobia. While they demonstrate their wantonness we should all rise above their imperfection and demand for them to present the evidence (pertinent ICBC (London) plc files). Please ask the Manhattan U.S. Attorney Office for the complete ICBC (London) plc files if they truly believe contempt or fraud occurred.</p>
					<p>On May 18, 2019, Raheem J. Brennerman`s mother passed away. At the time of his arrest in 2017 his mother was sick and he was a match (as a kidney donor) however although Mr. Brennerman pleaded to both Judge Richard J. Sullivan and the prosecution to allow him access to the evidence (pertinent ICBC (London) plc underwriting file) so that he may promptly clear his name and return to care for his mother, they both ignored him and in May 2019 she passed away while waiting for Mr. Brennerman to clear his name and return to care for her.</p>
					<p>The United States Constitution protects all Persons within its territories and jurisdiction irrespective of their race, gender or religion. The Constitution states that all Persons shall benefit from the equal protection of law. The Courts can only function based on public trust in the judicial institution. The attack on Raheem Jefferson Brennerman is an attack on the rule of law, civil rights and liberties affecting all Persons as well as the very fabric of our nation`s democracy. We call on U.S. Congress to immediately investigate how federal judges - Judge Lewis A. Kaplan and Judge Richard J. Sullivan have abused their power and used it to deprive a respected businessman of his liberty simply due to his race.</p>

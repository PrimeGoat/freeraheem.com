                <h2>QUESTIONABLE ACTIONS (BIAS) BY JUDGE KAPLAN & JUDGE SULLIVAN</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="subSection">
                <p class="bold">I. QUESTIONABLE AND ADVERSE ACTIONS UNDERTAKEN BY JUDGE LEWIS A. KAPLAN:</p>

                <ol type="a" class="justify">
                <li>Judge Kaplan ignored the law in "OSRecovery, Inc., v. One Groupe Int`l, Inc., 462 F.3d 87, 90 (2d Cir. 2006) and invited plaintiff in the civil case, ICBC (London) plc to move for contempt against Brennerman personally, even though he [Brennerman] was not a defendant in the civil case, no discovery demands were directed at him, he was never present in the courtroom for discussions on the issue of contempt, and he was not represented by counsel.</li>
                <li>On December 7, 2016, Judge Kaplan signed an order to show cause to hold Brennerman in contempt personally completely ignoring the fact that Brennerman and Blacksands (the civil case defendant) had just provided a substantial document production in November 2016, a few weeks earlier.</li>
                <li>Judge Kaplan scheduled the civil contempt hearing against Brennerman for only 4 days after granting ICBC`s order to show cause and required that opposition papers be filed by 4.00 p.m on a Sunday.</li>
                <li>Judge Kaplan denied Brennerman`s request for additional time to appoint new counsel. The counsel that represented him, Paul Weiss LLP, could not appear before Judge Kaplan given that the Judge was previously a partner at that law firm and proceeded with the contempt hearing in the absence of Brennerman or his counsel.</li>
                <li>Judge Kaplan made a number of statements indicating bias towards Brennerman including for example: the Court (Judge Kaplan) "presumed" that the Government would not be able to find Brennerman when there was no basis for that conclusion: the Court (Judge Kaplan) stated that "there is a long history in this case of attempts by Brennerman to delay, obscure and avoid various reckonings" and the Court (Judge Kaplan) stated incorrectly that "Latham attorneys had reported that Brennerman had "refused" to provide his address."</li>
                <li>Judge Kaplan insinuated himself in an unusual extent into the charging process, not merely referring the matter for criminal prosecution but opposing and overruling the less aggressive action taken by the prosecutors, replacing the prosecutors filing with a new order to show cause along with an arrest warrant already prepared by the Court (Judge Kaplan) then actively worked to persuade the prosecutors to devote Government resources to the apprehension of an individual (Brennerman) who according to the prosecution, had shown no inclination to "abscond". Judge Kaplan then sentenced Brennerman, a non party, to an increased term of imprisonment for allegedly causing the Government to devote significant Governmental resources toward his prosecution.</li>
                <li>The Court (Judge Kaplan) presumed that Brennerman's effort to retain counsel - a lawyer at Paul Weiss where Judge Kaplan was previously a partner - had a sinister purpose: to disqualify Judge Kaplan from the case, even though Paul Weiss had been representing Brennerman since 2007.</li>
                <li>Judge Kaplan actually investigated and researched Brennerman by Googling him (which is against federal rule), and then forwarded the material to another Judge in advance of the bail hearing, constituting unusual and extra-judicial activity.</li>
                <li>Judge Kaplan issued order that directed Brennerman`s case be tried by a jury - even though the Government took "no position" as to whether the case should be set for a bench trial or jury trial - indicating that the Court (Judge Kaplan) was determined to conduct an entire jury trial on the issue of an alleged failure to produce documents so that it could then sentence Brennerman to more than the maximum period of six months imprisonment. Judge Kaplan ultimately sentenced Brennerman to 24 months.</li>
                <li>Judge Kaplan, the complainant (that referred Brennerman for criminal prosecution for court orders that were directed at Blacksands and not Brennerman himself) then presided over the criminal case and trial.</li>
                <li>Judge Kaplan then ruled prior to trial, denying subpoena to compel evidence: the complete ICBC underwriting files, thus depriving Brennerman of the very evidence which he required to demonstrate his innocence and to challenge the testimony of Government witnesses at trial.</li>
                <li>At trial, Judge Kaplan's ruling caused the preclusion of evidence concerning settlement discussion, particularly with his erroneous jury instruction regarding settlement discussion, while also excluding defendant`s theory from the jury instruction</li>
                <li>At trial, Judge Kaplan admitted evidence of his prior ruling finding of civil contempt, while excluding evidence concerning the circumstances of those contempt findings. This was particularly egregious given that the Court (Judge Kaplan) admitted evidence of erroneously adjudged civil contempt order to be presented to the jury causing significant prejudice to Brennerman.</li>
                </ol>

                <p class="bold">II. QUESTIONABLE AND ADVERSE ACTION UNDERTAKEN BY JUDGE RICHARD J. SULLIVAN</p>

                <ol type="a" class="justify">
                <li>Prior to trial, Judge Sullivan denied Brennerman`s motion-in-limine to exclude testimony from ICBC (London) plc because Brennerman had been deprived access to the relevant ICBC London underwriting files which was patently unfair and highly prejudicial for the prosecution to be able to elicit testimony from ICBC (London) plc at trial while Brennerman would be unable to challenge the testimony or engage in any meaningful cross-examination of Government witness from ICBC (London) plc, Julian Madgett as to substance and credibility of the issues. Judge Sullivan allowed Brennerman to suffer prejudice.</li>
                <li>During trial, following testimony by Government sole witness from ICBC (London) plc, Julian Madgett, as to the existence of underwriting files (which documented the materiality and basis for the approval of the bridge loan) in the bank`s file in London, United Kingdom, Brennerman again made motion to the Court (Judge Sullivan) to compel for those evidence (at 1:17-CR-337-RJS, doc. no. 71). The Court (Judge Sullivan) who had an obligation to protect Brennerman`s constitutional rights, denied his request to compel for evidence which he required to present a complete defense and to challenge the testimony of Julian Madgett as to substance and credibility on the issues. The denial violated Brennerman`s Sixth Amendment Constitutional rights.</li>
                <li>After trial, Judge Sullivan denied Brennerman`s request to compel for the ICBC underwriting files (at 1:17-CR-337-RJS, doc. nos. 153, 161, 187, 200, 236, 237, 241) which Brennerman required to present with arguments in his post-trial motions and to present as clear and convincing evidence for bail.</li>
                <li>Judge Richard J. Sullivan in the prosecution for the bank fraud and bank fraud conspiracy case surreptitiously misrepresented the facts of the evidence (simply fabricated the evidence) in an endeavor to falsely satisfy the FDIC essential element necessary to convict Brennerman for bank fraud and bank fraud conspiracy by improperly supplanting a non-FDIC insured institution, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC for a FDIC-insured institution, Morgan Stanley Private Bank, where there was no evidence presented at trial to demonstrate that Brennerman interacted with Morgan Stanley Private Bank. Judge Sullivan also intentionally ignored the law and evidence presented by Brennerman (at 1:17-CR-337-RJS, doc. no. 167) in an endeavor to wrongly convict and imprison him. On January 22, 2021 and February 2, 2021, Brennerman submitted motion with evidence to highlight the misrepresentation issue. The evidence is on the Court record at 1:17-CR-337 (RJS), doc. no. 254.</li>
                <li>At the appearance on November 19, 2018, Judge Sullivan called Brennerman "A Con Man"; "A Crook"; "A Liar" among others personal insult directed at Brennerman. Judge Sullivan's denials for request to compel for evidence would have demonstrated Brennerman`s innocence and allowed him to present a complete defense. Such statements by a Federal Judge who is required to be a neutral arbiter demonstrates the preconceived bias which Judge Sullivan harbored towards Brennerman and were intended to cause maximum reputational damage to Brennerman.</li>
                <li>Bias was also demonstrated when Judge Sullivan in June 2017 acknowledged (following demonstrable evidence present by the defense) that the prosecution had falsely stated the nature of a real estate transaction during Brennerman`s June 1, 2017 arraignment on the fraud charges leading the Court to deny his bail. However, Judge Sullivan was unconcerned that the prosecution had falsely stated a material fact.</li>
                <li>Recently, during the coronavirus pandemic when the country and indeed the world was on lock-down, Judge Sullivan denied Brennerman`s request for documents which he required to present clear and convincing evidence with his bail application. While ignoring the law and Brennerman`s right to liberty, Judge Sullivan stated that Brennerman was a flight risk (even though the country was on lock-down with no way to fly) while also denying Brennerman access to the documents which Brennerman required to rebut such presumption as to flight risk.</li>
                <li>Judge Sullivan ignored Brennerman when he pleaded with the Court (Judge Sullivan) to allow him obtain the evidence (ICBC documents) which he required to prove his innocence so that he may return to care for his mother (an International black woman) because Brennerman was a match as an organ donor to her (see 1:17-CR-337-RJS, doc. no. 188). Judge Sullivan ignored him and Brennerman`s mother passed away on May 18, 2019 while waiting on Brennerman to clear his name and return to care for her.</li>

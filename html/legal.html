            <div class="subSection">
                <p class="center bold xlarge">THIS IS A PERSECUTION (NOT A PROSECUTION)</p>

                <p class="justify">THE LEGAL STORY:</p>
                <p class="justify">Raheem Jefferson Brennerman was prosecuted on two separate charges, and tried in front of two separate judges all in 2017. Raheem went to prison in 2019 from federal detention.</p>
                <p class="justify bold larger">1.) JUDGE KAPLAN TRIED RAHEEM FOR THE CHARGE OF CRIMINAL CONTEMPT OF COURT.</p>
                <p class="justify">Judge Kaplan broke two federal rule in targeting Raheem. </p>
                <p class="justify">First, Judge Kaplan broke federal rule by Googling Raheem so as to target him. </p>
                <p class="justify">Second, Judge Kaplan broke the law in "OSRecovery, Inc., v. One Groupe Int'l, Inc., 462 F.3d 87, 90 (2006)" to charge Raheem even though Raheem was not a party to the underlying civil case. </p>
                <p class="justify">Judge Kaplan ignored the rule and ethics to preside over this case, even though he asked the federal prosecutors to charge Raheem. By doing so, Judge Kaplan acted as the judge, the jury and the executioner. </p>
                <p class="justify">Judge Kaplan sentenced Raheem to 24 months in jail for a crime he did not commit. </p>
                <p class="justify">Raheem did not commit this crime. Raheem should not be in prison for this crime. </p>
                <p class="justify bold larger">2.) JUDGE SULLIVAN TRIED RAHEEM FOR CHARGES OF BANK AND WIRE FRAUD.</p>
                <p class="justify">Judge Sullivan carried out two separate pieces of judicial misconduct in targeting Raheem. </p>
                <p class="justify">First, under the charge of bank fraud, Judge Sullivan misrepresented that Raheem banked with a FDIC-insured bank (Morgan Stanley Private Bank). Yet there was NO evidence of this, in fact the evidence presented was that Raheen banked with a non-bank, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC. There was no bank fraud. </p>
                <p class="justify">Manhattan prosecutors argued that bank fraud occurred based on an account Raheem opened for a few weeks with an institution, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC which is not a bank. </p>
                <p class="justify">The prosecutors pivoted and presented that Raheem banked with Morgan Stanley Private Bank. Judge Sullivan argued that Raheem banked with the Morgan Stanley Private bank and that he received "perks" worth $6,000 such as sky miles and fancy credit card. But Raheem did not bank with Morgan Stanley Private Bank. Even with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC, where he banked, the credit card was closed with zero balance and Raheem did not have the account open long enough to even earn any sky miles. </p>
                <p class="justify">The law says that prosecutors cannot prosecute bank fraud unless the account is with an institution which is FDIC insured, however Judge Sullivan and prosecutors ignored the law. In fact, when Raheem highlighted evidence to the judge he just ignored him.  </p>
                <p class="justify">Second, Judge Sullivan refused to allow Raheem access to the key piece of evidence (ICBC underwriting file) which would have proven Raheem's innocence. The judge allowed government witness, Julian Madgett to testify to the existence of the file yet refused Raheem's multiple pleas to obtain the file. </p>
                <p class="justify">Judge Sullivan sentenced Raheem to several years in jail for crimes he did not commit. </p>
                <p class="justify">Raheem did not commit these crimes. Raheem should not be in prison for these crimes. </p>
                <p class="justify">Judge Sullivan carried out gross judicial misconduct over this case. </p>
                <p class="justify">ASK MANHATTAN FEDERAL PROSECUTORS AND FEDERAL COURT (JUDGE KAPLAN AND JUDGE SULLIVAN) TO SHOW US THE EVIDENCE - THE ICBC UNDERWRITING FILES, IF THEY TRULY BELIEVE FRAUD OR CONTEMPT OCCURRED. </p>

                <p class="justify">Judge Richard J. Sullivan caused significant prejudice and Constitutional violation to Raheem when he (Judge Sullivan) under-handedly replaced evidence of a non-FDIC insured institution (no bank) with a FDIC insured institution (a bank) where there was/is no other supporting evidence for such replacement. The reason Judge Sullivan did so was so as to falsely satisfy the law to convict and imprison Raheem. No bank no fraud. </p>
                <p class="justify">In the endeavor to falsely convict and imprison Raheem, Judge Sullivan also intentionally denied Raheem's request for the ICBC underwriting file while allowing the government witness to testify that the file exists and about its contents. Judge Sullivan knew that by denying Raheem access to the file, Raheem would be unable to exercise his Constitutional right to challenge the testimony of government witness or defend himself. </p>
                <p class="justify">Raheem has requested Judge Sullivan for the ICBC underwriting file which he believes will prove his innocence twelve (12) times to-date, including during trial, see 17 CR. 337 (RJS), at doc. no. 71 and after-trial, see 17 CR. 337 (RJS), at doc. nos. 153, 161, 187, 200, 236, 240, 241, 248, 250, 254, 256. Each time Judge Sullivan has either ignored Raheem's request or simply just denied him. </p>
                <p class="justify">In response to Raheem's latest request (dated March 6, 2021 and presented above), where Raheem also accused Judge Sullivan of fabricating evidence to convict him, the response from the Judge was just one word "Denied". Nothing else. </p>
                <p class="justify">Why is Judge Sullivan not explaining his decision. We say he cannot. No bank no fraud. No file no trial. As a result Raheem's Constitutional rights have been violated. Raheem should be exonerated and set free......</p>            </div>

            </div>
            <div class="subSection">
                <p class="bold">I. QUESTIONABLE AND ADVERSE ACTIONS UNDERTAKEN BY JUDGE LEWIS A. KAPLAN:</p>

                <ol type="a" class="justify">
                <li>Judge Kaplan ignored the law in "OSRecovery, Inc., v. One Groupe Int'l, Inc., 462 F.3d 87, 90 (2d Cir. 2006) and invited plaintiff in the civil case, ICBC (London) plc to move for contempt against Brennerman personally, even though he [Brennerman] was not a defendant in the civil case, no discovery demands were directed at him, he was never present in the courtroom for discussions on the issue of contempt, and he was not represented by counsel.</li>
                <li>On December 7, 2016, Judge Kaplan signed an order to show cause to hold Brennerman in contempt personally completely ignoring the fact that Brennerman and Blacksands (the civil case defendant) had just provided a substantial document production in November 2016, a few weeks earlier.</li>
                <li>Judge Kaplan scheduled the civil contempt hearing against Brennerman for only 4 days after granting ICBC's order to show cause and required that opposition papers be filed by 4.00 p.m on a Sunday.</li>
                <li>Judge Kaplan denied Brennerman's request for additional time to appoint new counsel. The counsel that represented him, Paul Weiss LLP, could not appear before Judge Kaplan given that the Judge was previously a partner at that law firm and proceeded with the contempt hearing in the absence of Brennerman or his counsel.</li>
                <li>Judge Kaplan made a number of statements indicating bias towards Brennerman including for example: the Court (Judge Kaplan) "presumed" that the Government would not be able to find Brennerman when there was no basis for that conclusion: the Court (Judge Kaplan) stated that "there is a long history in this case of attempts by Brennerman to delay, obscure and avoid various reckonings" and the Court (Judge Kaplan) stated incorrectly that "Latham attorneys had reported that Brennerman had "refused" to provide his address."</li>
                <li>Judge Kaplan insinuated himself in an unusual extent into the charging process, not merely referring the matter for criminal prosecution but opposing and overruling the less aggressive action taken by the prosecutors, replacing the prosecutors filing with a new order to show cause along with an arrest warrant already prepared by the Court (Judge Kaplan) then actively worked to persuade the prosecutors to devote Government resources to the apprehension of an individual (Brennerman) who according to the prosecution, had shown no inclination to "abscond". Judge Kaplan then sentenced Brennerman, a non party, to an increased term of imprisonment for allegedly causing the Government to devote significant Governmental resources toward his prosecution.</li>
                <li>The Court (Judge Kaplan) presumed that Brennerman's effort to retain counsel - a lawyer at Paul Weiss where Judge Kaplan was previously a partner - had a sinister purpose: to disqualify Judge Kaplan from the case, even though Paul Weiss had been representing Brennerman since 2007.</li>
                <li>Judge Kaplan actually investigated and researched Brennerman by Googling him (which is against federal rule), and then forwarded the material to another Judge in advance of the bail hearing, constituting unusual and extra-judicial activity.</li>
                <li>Judge Kaplan issued order that directed Brennerman's case be tried by a jury - even though the Government took "no position" as to whether the case should be set for a bench trial or jury trial - indicating that the Court (Judge Kaplan) was determined to conduct an entire jury trial on the issue of an alleged failure to produce documents so that it could then sentence Brennerman to more than the maximum period of six months imprisonment. Judge Kaplan ultimately sentenced Brennerman to 24 months.</li>
                <li>Judge Kaplan, the complainant (that referred Brennerman for criminal prosecution for court orders that were directed at Blacksands and not Brennerman himself) then presided over the criminal case and trial.</li>
                <li>Judge Kaplan then ruled prior to trial, denying subpoena to compel evidence: the complete ICBC underwriting files, thus depriving Brennerman of the very evidence which he required to demonstrate his innocence and to challenge the testimony of Government witnesses at trial.</li>
                <li>At trial, Judge Kaplan's ruling caused the preclusion of evidence concerning settlement discussion, particularly with his erroneous jury instruction regarding settlement discussion, while also excluding defendant's theory from the jury instruction</li>
                <li>At trial, Judge Kaplan admitted evidence of his prior ruling finding of civil contempt, while excluding evidence concerning the circumstances of those contempt findings. This was particularly egregious given that the Court (Judge Kaplan) admitted evidence of erroneously adjudged civil contempt order to be presented to the jury causing significant prejudice to Brennerman.</li>
                </ol>

                <p class="bold">II. QUESTIONABLE AND ADVERSE ACTION UNDERTAKEN BY JUDGE RICHARD J. SULLIVAN</p>

                <ol type="a" class="justify">
                <li>Prior to trial, Judge Sullivan denied Brennerman's motion-in-limine to exclude testimony from ICBC (London) plc because Brennerman had been deprived access to the relevant ICBC London underwriting files which was patently unfair and highly prejudicial for the prosecution to be able to elicit testimony from ICBC (London) plc at trial while Brennerman would be unable to challenge the testimony or engage in any meaningful cross-examination of Government witness from ICBC (London) plc, Julian Madgett as to substance and credibility of the issues. Judge Sullivan allowed Brennerman to suffer prejudice.</li>
                <li>During trial, following testimony by Government sole witness from ICBC (London) plc, Julian Madgett, as to the existence of underwriting files (which documented the materiality and basis for the approval of the bridge loan) in the bank's file in London, United Kingdom, Brennerman again made motion to the Court (Judge Sullivan) to compel for those evidence (at 1:17-CR-337-RJS, doc. no. 71). The Court (Judge Sullivan) who had an obligation to protect Brennerman's constitutional rights, denied his request to compel for evidence which he required to present a complete defense and to challenge the testimony of Julian Madgett as to substance and credibility on the issues. The denial violated Brennerman's Sixth Amendment Constitutional rights.</li>
                <li>After trial, Judge Sullivan denied Brennerman's request to compel for the ICBC underwriting files (at 1:17-CR-337-RJS, doc. nos. 153, 161, 187, 200, 236, 237, 241) which Brennerman required to present with arguments in his post-trial motions and to present as clear and convincing evidence for bail.</li>
                <li>Judge Richard J. Sullivan in the prosecution for the bank fraud and bank fraud conspiracy case surreptitiously misrepresented the facts of the evidence (simply fabricated the evidence) in an endeavor to falsely satisfy the FDIC essential element necessary to convict Brennerman for bank fraud and bank fraud conspiracy by improperly supplanting a non-FDIC insured institution, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC for a FDIC-insured institution, Morgan Stanley Private Bank, where there was no evidence presented at trial to demonstrate that Brennerman interacted with Morgan Stanley Private Bank. Judge Sullivan also intentionally ignored the law and evidence presented by Brennerman (at 1:17-CR-337-RJS, doc. no. 167) in an endeavor to wrongly convict and imprison him. On January 22, 2021 and February 2, 2021, Brennerman submitted motion with evidence to highlight the misrepresentation issue. The evidence is on the Court record at 1:17-CR-337 (RJS), doc. no. 254.</li>
                <li>At the appearance on November 19, 2018, Judge Sullivan called Brennerman "A Con Man"; "A Crook"; "A Liar" among others personal insult directed at Brennerman. Judge Sullivan's denials for request to compel for evidence would have demonstrated Brennerman's innocence and allowed him to present a complete defense. Such statements by a Federal Judge who is required to be a neutral arbiter demonstrates the preconceived bias which Judge Sullivan harbored towards Brennerman and were intended to cause maximum reputational damage to Brennerman.</li>
                <li>Bias was also demonstrated when Judge Sullivan in June 2017 acknowledged (following demonstrable evidence present by the defense) that the prosecution had falsely stated the nature of a real estate transaction during Brennerman's June 1, 2017 arraignment on the fraud charges leading the Court to deny his bail. However, Judge Sullivan was unconcerned that the prosecution had falsely stated a material fact.</li>
                <li>Recently, during the coronavirus pandemic when the country and indeed the world was on lock-down, Judge Sullivan denied Brennerman's request for documents which he required to present clear and convincing evidence with his bail application. While ignoring the law and Brennerman's right to liberty, Judge Sullivan stated that Brennerman was a flight risk (even though the country was on lock-down with no way to fly) while also denying Brennerman access to the documents which Brennerman required to rebut such presumption as to flight risk.</li>
                <li>Judge Sullivan ignored Brennerman when he pleaded with the Court (Judge Sullivan) to allow him obtain the evidence (ICBC documents) which he required to prove his innocence so that he may return to care for his mother (an International black woman) because Brennerman was a match as an organ donor to her (see 1:17-CR-337-RJS, doc. no. 188). Judge Sullivan ignored him and Brennerman's mother passed away on May 18, 2019 while waiting on Brennerman to clear his name and return to care for her.</li>

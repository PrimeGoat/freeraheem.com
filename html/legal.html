            <div class="subSection bold">
                <p class="center">THIS IS A PERSECUTION (NOT A PROSECUTION)</p>

                <p>JUDGE LEWIS A. KAPLAN GOOGLED RAHEEM BRENNERMAN THEN DEPRIVED HIM EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAW</p>
                <ul class="justify">
                    <li>From the outset this prosecution was racially motivated and wrong. Brennerman faces racial injustice with his wrongful prosecution and false imprisonment following U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan ("Judge Kaplan") ignoring the federal rule to Google him then depriving him of the equal protection of the law upon realizing that he is a black man to convict and imprison him for criminal contempt of court even though Brennerman was not a party to the underlying civil case between ICBC (London) plc and The Blacksands Pacific Group, Inc. (The Second Circuit Federal Manhattan Appeals Court in "OSRecovery, Inc., v. One Groupe, Int`l, Inc., 462 F.3d 87, 90 (2d Cir. 2006)" previously stated directly to Judge Kaplan that he could not hold a non-party in contempt)</li>
                    <li>Judge Kaplan ignored the law to hold Brennerman in contempt then persuaded the Manhattan prosecutors (Assistant United States Attorneys Nicolas Landsman-Roos and Robert Benjamin Sobelman together with their investigator Justin Ellard) to arrest Brennerman and prosecute him criminally even though the law clearly says that the Judge cannot do this to someone who was/is not part of the case. The Manhattan prosecutors, without considering the law, then arrested Brennerman at his home even though there was/were no pending charges against him and no order had been made by the Court to include him in the underlying civil case.</li>
                    <li>During trial, Judge Kaplan denied Brennerman`s request for evidence from ICBC (London) plc which he required to defend himself while allowing the Manhattan prosecutors to present to the jury that Judge Kaplan already held Brennerman in contempt, even though that order of contempt by Judge Kaplan was adjudged in contrast with the law. A juror named Gordon stated that the contempt adjudged by Judge Kaplan against Brennerman swayed the jury to find Brennerman guilty of criminal contempt of court (see 1:17-CR-337-RJS, doc. no. 236, Exhibit 3).</li>
                    <li>The Second Circuit Manhattan Federal Appeals Court then refused to correct their erroneous decision creating disparity between Brennerman and their prior decision regarding adjudging contempt against non-parties. It also created disparity with the Supreme Court decision that criminal defendants have constitutional right to present a complete defense.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>JUDGE RICHARD J. SULLIVAN AND THE MANHATTAN PROSECUTORS FALSELY STATED FACTS AND EVIDENCE THEN IGNORED THE LAW TO WRONGLY CONVICT AND IMPRISON RAHEEM BRENNERMAN</p>
                <ul class="justify">
                    <li>Within six weeks of Judge Kaplan referring Brennerman to the Manhattan prosecutors seeking for him to be prosecuted criminally, the Manhattan prosecutors in addition to charging Brennerman for criminal contempt of court also indicted him for fraud, announcing an indictment for "$300 MILLION INTERNATIONAL FRAUD" even though there was no investigation that preceded the indictment.</li>
                </ul>

                    <div class="plusMinus"><b>[ + ]</b></div> <u>BANK FRAUD CASE:</u>
                </div>
                <div class="collapsible">
                    <ul class="justify">
                        <li>Manhattan prosecutors argued that bank fraud occurred based on an account Brennerman opened for a few weeks with an institution, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC which is not a bank. Brennerman deposited his own money and did not ask for any loan and did not receive any money. The prosecutors pivoted and the Judge argued that Brennerman received "perks" worth $6,000 such as sky miles and fancy credit card, even though the credit card was closed with zero balance and Brennerman did not have the account open long enough to even earn any sky miles. The law says that prosecutors cannot prosecute bank fraud unless the account is with an institution which is FDIC insured, however the Court and prosecutors ignored the law. In fact, when Brennerman highlighted it to the judge he just ignored Brennerman.</li>
                        <li>Judge Richard J. Sullivan then engaged in a surreptitious endeavor to falsely satisfy the FDIC essential element necessary to convict Brennerman for bank fraud and bank fraud conspiracy by improperly supplanting a non-FDIC insured institution, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC "MSSB" (which Government presented as Government Exhibit - GX1-57; GX1-57A; GX529; GX1-73, during trial as evidence of Brennerman`s interaction with Morgan Stanley (see 1:17-CR-337-RJS, doc. no. 167)) with a FDIC insured institution, Morgan Stanley Private Bank "MSPB" (even though Government presented no evidence of Brennerman`s interaction with MSPB (see 1:17-CR-337-RJS, doc. no 206), in an endeavor to wrongly convict and imprison Brennerman.</li>
                        <li>On appeal, the Second Circuit Federal Manhattan Court ("Second Circuit") ignored trial testimony from Government witnesses, Barry Gonzalez and Kevin Bonebrake, who testified that Morgan Stanley & Co, LLC is not FDIC-insured and operates through various subsidiaries; that Brennerman opened his wealth management account with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC, a non-FDIC insured subsidiary of Morgan Stanley & Co, LLC; and that each subsidiary requires its own FDIC certificate as the FDIC certificate of one subsidiary does not cover another subsidiary or the parent company (see 1:17-CR-337-RJS, trial transcripts 384-385; 387-388; 409; 1057-1061). Instead the Second Circuit generalized by stating that Brennerman defrauded "Morgan Stanley, an FDIC insured institution" without considering the trial records. The Second Circuit also stated incorrectly that the bank fraud was about a single phone call which Brennerman had with Kevin Bonebrake about oil asset financing without acknowledging trial testimony where Mr. Bonebrake told the Court that the call was "very preliminary discussion" and that the company where he worked was not expected to provide any money but instead expected to help raise financing from investors. Here as well, the law says that the prosecutors cannot prosecute Brennerman unless his phone call was with someone that worked for a bank. Kevin Bonebrake worked for another non-FDIC insured subsidiary of Morgan Stanley. The Court and prosecutors ignored the law.</li>

                    <div class="plusMinus"><b>[ + ]</b></div> <u>WIRE FRAUD CASE:</u>
                </div>
                <div class="collapsible">
                    <ul class="justify">
                        <li>Prior to trial for the fraud case, Brennerman requested for evidence of the fraud however the Manhattan prosecutors advised him that they were not obligated to obtain the evidence (the complete ICBC underwriting files) from the bank (ICBC (London) plc which is based in London, United Kingdom. In-fact to-date while Brennerman is imprisoned the Manhattan prosecutors have never obtained or reviewed the evidence.</li>
                        <li>Prior to trial for the fraud case, Brennerman argued to the Court (Judge Richard J. Sullivan) that he would not be able to defend himself without the evidence (the ICBC underwriting file) however Judge Sullivan ignored him and allowed the Government witness, Julian Madgett from ICBC (London) plc to testify even though the Judge knew that Brennerman would not be able to confront the witness or present a complete defense. The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution states that every criminal defendant has the right to obtain evidence in their favor and shall have the ability to confront witness against them, however the Judge who had an obligation to protect Brennerman`s Constitutional rights failed to do so and Brennerman was not able to effectively cross examine the witness.</li>
                        <li>During trial the Government presented their sole witness, Julian Madgett from ICBC (London) plc to testify as to the contents of the underwriting file without ever obtaining or reviewing it themselves. The ICBC (London) plc underwriting file documents the basis for approving the bridge finance and thus highlights the representations or alleged misrepresentations that were "Material" (an essential element of the charged crime) to the approval of the bridge loan. Without the Government independently obtaining or reviewing the underwriting file, the entire case/prosecution is based solely on the uncorroborated testimony of Julian Madgett from ICBC (London) plc.  This is a violation of Brennerman`s Due Process right. More importantly, Brennerman was deprived of the ability to use the ICBC underwriting file to challenge the testimony of Julian Madgett or to present a complete defense as stipulated by the Sixth Amendment. The ICBC (London) plc underwriting file will show that ICBC (London) plc did not rely on any representations by Brennerman in its approval of the bridge finance because they relied on other information not presented at trial.</li>
                        <li>During trial, Government sole witness from ICBC (London) plc, Julian Madgett testified (at 1:17-CR-377-RJS, trial transcript 551-554) that evidence exists, ICBC underwriting file which documents the basis for the bank approving the bridge finance and that Government never obtained or reviewed the evidence.  Brennerman immediately through defense counsel, Thompson Hine LLP filed motion (at 1:17-CR-337-RJS, doc. no. 71) to request that Judge Sullivan compel the Government to obtain the ICBC underwriting file and/or subpoena ICBC (London) plc to present the ICBC underwriting file to Brennerman, for his defense however Judge Sullivan denied the request stating (at 1:17-CR-337-RJS, trial transcript 617) that the witness, Julian Madgett had testified that the ICBC underwriting file was with the bank`s file in London, United Kingdom and that the witness testified that he had not reviewed it in preparation for his testimony.</li>
                        <li>On appeal, the Second Circuit Manhattan Federal Appeals Court ignored the trial records and stated incorrectly that the evidence, ICBC underwriting file, which Brennerman requested/required to defend himself did not exist beyond Brennerman`s bare assertion and thus the Government had met its disclosure obligations, however trial record (at 1:17-CR-337-RJS, trial transcript 551-554) clearly shows that Government witness, Julian Madgett testified and confirmed that the evidence exists with the bank in London, United Kingdom and trial record (at 1:17-CR-337-RJS, trial transcript 617) clearly demonstrates Judge Sullivan acknowledging that the witness, Julian Madgett had testified to the existence of the evidence, ICBC underwriting file with the bank`s file in London, U.K., therefore the Second Circuit Court disposition was erroneous.</li>
                        <li>After trial, Brennerman in an endeavor to obtain the ICBC underwriting file and other evidence (which Government failed to present to the jury at trial including his birth certificate) so as to prepare comprehensive post-trial motions requested for the evidence (at 1:17-CR-337-RJS, doc. nos. 153, 161, 187, 200, 236, 240, 241, 248, 250, 254) however Judge Sullivan has continued to deny Brennerman`s requests.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div><br>
                <!-- Collapse end -->

                <ul class="justify">
                    <li>In December 2020, Brennerman submitted to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ("Manhattan Federal Appeals Court") (at 18-3546, doc. nos. 211, 217 for the fraud case and at 18-1033, doc. no 334) evidence of the erroneous disposition to allow the Second Circuit Court to correct its errors. However to-date the Manhattan Federal Appeals Court refuses to correct its error to free an innocent black man.</li>
                    <li>On January 22, 2021 and February 2, 2021, Brennerman submitted motion with evidence to Judge Richard J. Sullivan highlighting among others that Judge Richard J. Sullivan had falsely stated evidence in a surreptitious endeavor to convict and imprison him by improperly supplanting evidence of a non-FDIC insured institution with a FDIC insured institution. The evidence is on the Court record at 1:17-CR-337-RJS, doc. no. 254.</li>
                    <li>The entire prosecution was initiated at the behest of Judge Lewis A. Kaplan following Judge Kaplan Googling Brennerman and realizing that Brennerman is a black man and the Chairman and CEO for The Blacksands Pacific Group, Inc., one of three Black-owned oil and gas corporation in the United States.</li>
                    <li>Then, without any investigation and evidence of the alleged crime, the prosecutors pursued racism and xenophobia by concocting a story for the public. First, distorting Brennerman`s name, race, nationality and educational background, all in an endeavor to support their false narrative.</li>
                    <li>When the trial evidence did not support their narrative, Judge Sullivan falsely stated the evidence to falsely satisfy the FDIC essential element necessary to convict for bank fraud while intentionally depriving Brennerman access to the evidence which will demonstrate that there was no fraud.</li>
                    <li>To-date while Brennerman has continued to request for copy of his birth certificate and Passports which are in Government`s possession so as to refute the false narrative and story by the Government, both Judge Sullivan and the Manhattan prosecutors have continued to ignore his request.</li>

				<h2>SYSTEMIC OPPRESSION AND RACIAL INJUSTICE WITHIN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="subSection">
				<p class="justify">This was not a prosecution, it was a deliberate endeavor to ensure that I was arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned highlighting the systemic oppression and racial injustice that minorities face.</p>

				<div class="collapser">
					<div class="plusMinus"><b>[ + ]</b></div> <u>Federal Judge and Prosecutors ignored the law to prosecute and imprison an innocent black man for a crime of criminal contempt of court.</u>
				</div>
				<div class="collapsible">
					<p class="justify">In 2016, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan ignored the law when he Googled me (which is wrong because Federal rule prohibits Judges from conducting research by themselves since they are only required to make ruling based on the law and evidence presented) then held me in civil contempt of court even though I was not part of the case ("non-party"). I was never in court and I did not personally participate in the case and no court orders were personally issued to me, yet Judge Kaplan felt above the law to hold me in civil contempt of court. Then he referred me to the Manhattan prosecutors in the Southern District of New York and persuaded them to prosecute me criminally. The Manhattan prosecutors equally ignored the law and on Judge Kaplan`s orders arrested me and charged me with criminal contempt of court, even without ever being part of the civil case.</p>
					<p class="justify">I was granted bail in April 2017, and within three weeks without any investigation the Manhattan prosecutors indicted me for fraud based on the civil case. This time the fraud case was assigned to Judge Richard J. Sullivan who decided to detain and imprison me prior to trial. To prepare for trial, I asked the Manhattan prosecutors for evidence but they told me that they had never requested or obtained the evidence which was surprising because I did not understand how they could claim there was fraud without ever reviewing the evidence. Their excuse was that the evidence which I needed to defend myself was in London, U.K. and that they were not obligated to obtain it. More sobering was the Court`s denial of my request to compel for the evidence. The Court told me that since the evidence was in London, U.K. I could not issue subpoena to compel for the evidence.</p>
					<p class="justify">I proceeded to trial for criminal contempt of court without evidence I needed to demonstrate to the jury that even though the court orders were not directed to me personally, I was doing my best on behalf of the company to negotiate settlement with the Chinese bank since the court order stated to settle and representatives of the bank advised me that they were more interested in settlement than receiving documents which the orders had asked the company to provide. To make matters worse Judge Kaplan then allowed the Manhattan prosecutors to show the jury that he had already held me in civil contempt without explaining to them that he did it against the law or that I was not even in the country at the time when he held me in civil contempt and that I was not a party to the civil case itself. The jury decided that since the Judge presiding over the case had already held me in civil contempt then I must be guilty of criminal contempt. This was very wrong because the United States Constitution guarantees everyone the equal protection of the law but Judge Kaplan ignored the law to commence my prosecution. The Constitution also guarantees that every defendant is able to compel for evidence and witnesses in their favor during trial however both the Judge and the Manhattan prosecutors ensured that I did not gain access to the evidence which I required to defend myself and present a complete defense.</p>
					<p class="justify">If Judge Kaplan had followed the Federal Rule by not Googling me and the law by not holding me in contempt as a non-party then I would never have been arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned for an offence I did not commit.</p>
				</div><br>

				<div class="collapser">
					<div class="plusMinus"><b>[ + ]</b></div> <u>Federal Judge and Prosecutors denied an innocent black man access to evidence which he required to defend himself against wire fraud charge and to present a complete defense which was in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.</u>
				</div>
				<div class="collapsible">
					<p class="justify">With the fraud case, prior to trial, I made request to Judge Richard J. Sullivan arguing that since I have not been able to obtain the evidence from the Chinese bank, that the Court should exclude testimony from any witness from the bank as it would be patently unfair and highly prejudicial and more importantly would deprive me of my right to a fair trial guaranteed by the United States Constitution. Without the requested evidence the Manhattan prosecutors would be able to freely elicit testimony from the witness while I would be unable to challenge what he said, Judge Sullivan denied my request. Again during trial, when the sole witness from the bank flew from London, U.K. to the U.S to testify about contents of the evidence (the bank's underwriting files which documented the basis for approving the finance), neither the Manhattan prosecutors or the Judge requested the witness to bring along the evidence even though he was about to testify to contents of the evidence (the files). During trial, the witness confirmed that the evidence (the files) existed in London, U.K. and that he was one of the authors of the documents contained in the files. I again made request to the Court to compel for the evidence so that I could use it to defend myself and prove there was no fraud. The Court, who had an obligation to protect my Constitutional rights, instead stated that the witness had testified that the evidence was located in the bank`s file in London, United Kingdom and that the witness had not reviewed the files prior to his testimony and then went on to deny my request for the evidence. This was very wrong because the Court allowed the witness to provide testimony even though the Court itself acknowledged that the witness had not recently reviewed the evidence in preparation for his testimony so he was testifying based on his memory from four years earlier. More importantly, he was allowed to say anything and everything without providing me the opportunity to challenge his testimony or the opportunity for me to be able to present a complete defense.</p>
					<p class="justify">The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution allows all criminal defendants the opportunity to confront witnesses and evidence against them and to have the opportunity to compel for witnesses and evidence in their favor however in this case I have been denied the opportunity to do both when Judge Sullivan denied my several requests for the evidence (the files).</p>

					<div class="plusMinus"><b>[ + ]</b></div> <u>Federal Judge and Prosecutors ignored the law and evidence to prosecute and imprison an innocent black man for bank fraud.</u>
				</div>
				<div class="collapsible">
					<p class="justify">As if that was not bad enough, when the Manhattan prosecutors realized that they were not able to satisfy the law to charge me for bank fraud as it relates to the Chinese bank, they switched to focus on an account which I opened at Morgan Stanley. That account was opened in 2013, with an initial deposit by me, prior to realizing that the bank could not meet my level of service demand and I requested the account closed within a few weeks. The prosecutors argued that I became entitled to "perks" including sky miles, fancy credit card and favorable interest rate by opening the account, however I never used the credit card which I requested closed with zero balance and did not even have the account long enough to earn any sky miles. I never requested for any loan from Morgan Stanley. Most important the Morgan Stanley subsidiary is not federally insured which is required by law to be prosecuted for bank fraud.</p>
					<p class="justify">When I argued the above, the prosecution then again changed the theory of the bank fraud to a call I made in January 2013 to an employee of another subsidiary of Morgan Stanley to discuss financing about an oil asset. However that employee testified at trial that it was "very preliminary discussion" since it was a single phone call and that he was still confused what the company wanted. He testified that Morgan Stanley would not have been providing any finance since the company was seeking to engage Morgan Stanley to help raise money from third party investors but that it was an initial call to see if both the company and Morgan Stanley wanted to work together. Likewise that Morgan Stanley subsidiary is not federally insured as required by the law.</p>

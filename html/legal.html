                <p class="center bold xlarge">THIS IS A PERSECUTION (NOT A PROSECUTION)</p>

                <p class="justify">THE LEGAL STORY:</p>
                <p class="justify">Raheem Jefferson Brennerman was prosecuted on two separate charges, and tried in front of two separate judges all in 2017. Raheem went to prison in 2019 from federal detention.</p>
                <p class="justify bold larger">1.) JUDGE KAPLAN TRIED RAHEEM FOR THE CHARGE OF CRIMINAL CONTEMPT OF COURT.</p>
                <p class="justify">Judge Kaplan broke two federal rule in targeting Raheem. </p>
                <p class="justify">First, Judge Kaplan broke federal rule by Googling Raheem so as to target him. </p>
                <p class="justify">Second, Judge Kaplan broke the law in "OSRecovery, Inc., v. One Groupe Int'l, Inc., 462 F.3d 87, 90 (2006)" to charge Raheem even though Raheem was not a party to the underlying civil case. </p>
                <p class="justify">Judge Kaplan ignored the rule and ethics to preside over this case, even though he asked the federal prosecutors to charge Raheem. By doing so, Judge Kaplan acted as the judge, the jury and the executioner. </p>
                <p class="justify">Judge Kaplan sentenced Raheem to 24 months in jail for a crime he did not commit. </p>
                <p class="justify">Raheem did not commit this crime. Raheem should not be in prison for this crime. </p>
                <p class="justify bold larger">2.) JUDGE SULLIVAN TRIED RAHEEM FOR CHARGES OF BANK AND WIRE FRAUD.</p>
                <p class="justify">Judge Sullivan carried out two separate pieces of judicial misconduct in targeting Raheem. </p>
                <p class="justify">First, under the charge of bank fraud, Judge Sullivan misrepresented that Raheem banked with a FDIC-insured bank (Morgan Stanley Private Bank). Yet there was NO evidence of this, in fact the evidence presented was that Raheen banked with a non-bank, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC. There was no bank fraud. </p>
                <p class="justify">Manhattan prosecutors argued that bank fraud occurred based on an account Raheem opened for a few weeks with an institution, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC which is not a bank. </p>
                <p class="justify">The prosecutors pivoted and presented that Raheem banked with Morgan Stanley Private Bank. Judge Sullivan argued that Raheem banked with the Morgan Stanley Private bank and that he received "perks" worth $6,000 such as sky miles and fancy credit card. But Raheem did not bank with Morgan Stanley Private Bank. Even with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC, where he banked, the credit card was closed with zero balance and Raheem did not have the account open long enough to even earn any sky miles. </p>
                <p class="justify">The law says that prosecutors cannot prosecute bank fraud unless the account is with an institution which is FDIC insured, however Judge Sullivan and prosecutors ignored the law. In fact, when Raheem highlighted evidence to the judge he just ignored him.  </p>
                <p class="justify">Second, Judge Sullivan refused to allow Raheem access to the key piece of evidence (ICBC underwriting file) which would have proven Raheem's innocence. The judge allowed government witness, Julian Madgett to testify to the existence of the file yet refused Raheem's multiple pleas to obtain the file. </p>
                <p class="justify">Judge Sullivan sentenced Raheem to several years in jail for crimes he did not commit. </p>
                <p class="justify">Raheem did not commit these crimes. Raheem should not be in prison for these crimes. </p>
                <p class="justify">Judge Sullivan carried out gross judicial misconduct over this case. </p>
                <p class="justify">ASK MANHATTAN FEDERAL PROSECUTORS AND FEDERAL COURT (JUDGE KAPLAN AND JUDGE SULLIVAN) TO SHOW US THE EVIDENCE - THE ICBC UNDERWRITING FILES, IF THEY TRULY BELIEVE FRAUD OR CONTEMPT OCCURRED. </p>

                <p class="justify">Judge Richard J. Sullivan caused significant prejudice and Constitutional violation to Raheem when he (Judge Sullivan) under-handedly replaced evidence of a non-FDIC insured institution (no bank) with a FDIC insured institution (a bank) where there was/is no other supporting evidence for such replacement. The reason Judge Sullivan did so was so as to falsely satisfy the law to convict and imprison Raheem. No bank no fraud. </p>
                <p class="justify">In the endeavor to falsely convict and imprison Raheem, Judge Sullivan also intentionally denied Raheem's request for the ICBC underwriting file while allowing the government witness to testify that the file exists and about its contents. Judge Sullivan knew that by denying Raheem access to the file, Raheem would be unable to exercise his Constitutional right to challenge the testimony of government witness or defend himself. </p>
                <p class="justify">Raheem has requested Judge Sullivan for the ICBC underwriting file which he believes will prove his innocence twelve (12) times to-date, including during trial, see 17 CR. 337 (RJS), at doc. no. 71 and after-trial, see 17 CR. 337 (RJS), at doc. nos. 153, 161, 187, 200, 236, 240, 241, 248, 250, 254, 256. Each time Judge Sullivan has either ignored Raheem's request or simply just denied him. </p>
                <p class="justify">In response to Raheem's latest request (dated March 6, 2021 and presented above), where Raheem also accused Judge Sullivan of fabricating evidence to convict him, the response from the Judge was just one word "Denied". Nothing else. </p>
                <p class="justify">Why is Judge Sullivan not explaining his decision. We say he cannot. No bank no fraud. No file no trial. As a result Raheem's Constitutional rights have been violated. Raheem should be exonerated and set free......</p>            </div>

            <div class="subSection">
                <p class="bold">HISTORY OF THE CONSPIRACY TO DEPRIVE BRENNERMAN OF THE REQUESTED ICBC DOCUMENTS/EVIDENCE SO AS TO WRONGLY CONVICT AND FALSELY IMPRISON HIM</p>
                
                <p class="justify">
                    The history of this conspiracy commenced in 2016, when Judge Lewis A. Kaplan ignored the federal rule to conduct extra-judicial research into Brennerman including googling him and realizing that he is a black businessman. Judge Kaplan invited Linklaters LLP through Attorney Paul S. Hessler, who was responsible for the ICBC London relationship at Linklaters LLP's New York office to pursue Brennerman for contempt even while there was no court order directing Brennerman personally to do anything. The underlying civil case before Judge Lewis A. Kaplan at Civil Action No. 15 Cv. 0070 (LAK) was between ICBC (London) plc ("ICBC London") and The Blacksands Pacific Group, Inc ("BSPG"), an oil and gas corporation where Brennerman was Chairman and CEO. Without even filing a motion to compel Brennerman personally Mr. Hessler filed an order to hold Brennerman in contempt of court, illegally piercing through the corporate veil of BSPG. Judge Kaplan did not permit either Brennerman or his attorney enough time to appear in Court before granting Mr. Hessler's request and holding Brennerman personally in civil contempt. Following which Judge Kaplan then actively sought U.S. DOJ prosecutors at USAO, SDNY to prosecute Brennerman criminally. When the initial set of federal prosecutors refused to prosecute, Judge Kaplan actively sought more willing prosecutors. 
                </p><p class="justify">
                    In early 2017, the new U.S. DOJ prosecutors from USAO, SDNY charged Brenneman in two interrelated criminal cases, criminal contempt of court at case no. 17 Cr. 155 (LAK), before the same judge who initiated the prosecution, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan and fraud case at case no. 17 Cr. 337 (RJS) before Judge Richard J. Sullivan.
                    The criminal contempt of court case charged Brennerman with flagrant defiance and willful disobedience of a federal court order issued by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan  to BSPG notwithstanding that Brennerman was not personally named on the said court order. The fraud case charged Brennerman with fraud related to the bridge loan transaction between ICBC London, BSPG and BSPAB. Both criminal cases required the requested evidence/documents [underwriting file], [meeting minutes], [notes], [e-mail] from ICBC London, to demonstrate that neither BSPG or Brennerman willfully disobeyed or defied the court order, because agents of ICBC London continually advised agents of BSPG and Brennerman that they were interested in settling rather than receiving more discovery (BSPG had already provided over 400 pages of discovery at this point), compelling Brennerman and agents of BSPG to focus on settlement rather than discovery. A settlement was agreed-in-principle prior to commencement of the prosecution (see Draft Settlement Agreement at U.S. v. Brennerman et. ano., 17 Cr. 155 (LAK), EFC No. 12 Ex. 10), however Judge Kaplan insisted on proceeding with the criminal prosecution. The [underwriting file] was also required for Brennerman's defense in the fraud case for him to demonstrate that ICBC London did not rely on any representations or alleged misrepresentations by BSPG or Brennerman, in approving the bridge loan. 
                    However, Linklaters LLP through Attorney Paul S. Hessler conspired with the U.S. DOJ prosecutors at USAO, SDNY, acting on behalf of Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, to deprive Brennerman access to the documents/evidence by intentionally withholding the production of those pertinent and exculpatory evidence/documents to the U.S. DOJ prosecutors at USAO, SDNY, so as to ensure that they [prosecutors] would not produce the documents/evidence to Brennerman for his defense. 
                </p><p class="justify">
                    During trial of the fraud case, the U.S. DOJ prosecutors from USAO, SDNY presented their sole witness from ICBC London, Mr. Julian Madgett who testified to the jury as to the contents of the underwriting file in establishing the essential element of "Materiality" necessary to convict Brennerman, knowing that Brennerman had been deprived of the documents/evidence he required to challenge Mr. Madgett's testimony and defend himself. The U.S. DOJ prosecutors from USAO, SDNY never obtained or independently reviewed the underwriting file to corroborate the statements of Mr. Madgett prior to charging Brennerman with a crime or presenting his testimony at trial. More significantly, the U.S. DOJ prosecutors from USAO, SDNY never obtained or produced those documents/evidence to Brennerman for his defense. The reason why the prosecutors refused to obtain or independently review the underwriting file is so that they can argue that it [ICBC underwriting file] is not BRADY material, because if the documents/evidence were never in their custody then they can argue that they are not obligated to produce it to Brennerman for his defense. This was done with the deliberate intention to violate Brennerman's Constitutional rights. 
                </p><p class="justify">
                    At trial, Mr. Madgett testified as to the existence of the underwriting file, its importance to the criminal cases. He [Madgett] testified that the underwriting file documents the basis for the bank, ICBC London approving the bridge loan finance between ICBC London, BSPG and BSPAB, thus highlighting what the bank relied upon in approving the bridge loan. Yet the U.S. DOJ prosecutors from USAO, SDNY refused to obtain, review or produce the documents/evidence. Mr. Madgett also testified that the bank, ICBC (London) plc had produced all documents/evidence related to the transaction to their New York based counsel, Linklaters LLP and Attorney Paul S. Hessler and he [Madgett] was unaware whether those documents/evidence were fully turned over to the defense. See U.S. v. Brennerman, 17 Cr. 337 (RJS), trial tr. 551-554; see also U.S. v. Brennerman et. ano., 17 Cr. 155 (LAK), EFC No. 215 Ex. 1; and Brennerman v. U.S., 22 Cv. 996 (LAK), EFC No. 9 Ex. 1. 
                </p><p class="justify">
                    To convict Brennerman of bank fraud and bank fraud conspiracy, Judge Richard J. Sullivan then intentionally misrepresented (fabricated) evidence by surreptitiously supplanting Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC, a non-FDIC insured institution with Morgan Stanley Private Bank, a FDIC insured institution, so as to falsely satisfy the law to convict and imprison Brennerman. See U.S. v. Brennerman, 17 Cr. 337 (RJS), EFC Nos. 269, 270, 272, 274; see also 17 Cr. 337 (RJS), EFC No. 272 (emphasis added). Throughout the prosecution, both Judge Kaplan and Judge Sullivan intentionally denied and deprived Brennerman access to those ICBC London documents/evidence. They both repeatedly denied Brennerman's request for the documents/evidence. 
                </p><p class="justify">
                    During the appeal of the criminal convictions, as highlighted at U.S. v. Brennerman, 17 Cr. 337 (RJS), EFC No. 269, the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals panel court of three appellate judges, in an endeavour to protect Judge Sullivan, obfuscated on the issue of misrepresentation with respect to the bank fraud conviction and falsely stated in their affirmation summary order that "the only indication that such documents [ICBC underwriting file] are extant comes from Brennerman's bare assertions (Slip Op., No. 18-3546, EFC No. 183 at 4-5)" in contrast with the case record and testimony at U.S. v. Brennerman, 17 Cr. 337 (RJS), trial tr. 551-554. 
                </p><p class="justify">
                    Recently, during the criminal contempt of court collateral attack proceeding, on April 13, 2022, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan in an endeavour to cover-up the conspiracy, following Brennerman's request for ICBC evidence and extension to file reply motion, abruptly denied all pending motions and ordered closure of the entire collateral attack petition without any evidentiary hearing on the critical issue of conspiracy and ICBC file. Judge Kaplan's denial was to cover-up the conspiracy to deprive Brennerman of the ICBC evidence and testimony of Mr. Hessler to explain why he [Mr. Hessler] withheld the evidence. 
                    To date, after 6 months, Judge Richard J. Sullivan has remained silent following Brennerman's fraud case collateral attack on November 16, 2021, and while Brennerman continues his unwarranted incarceration.

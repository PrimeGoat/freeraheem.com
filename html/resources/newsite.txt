Black Oil businessman and Philanthropist Raheem Jefferson Brennerman, faces racial injustice with his wrongful prosecution and false imprisonment following a federal Judge Googling him and realizing that he is a black man, then deprived him the equal protection of the law. Manhattan federal Court then falsely stated facts about evidence and the existence of evidence (ICBC (London) plc underwriting file) which Raheem J. Brennerman required for his defense. The Court also ignored the law in an effort to wrongly convict and imprison an innocent black man.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Raheem Brennerman grew up between New York city and London. By studying hard at the tender young age of sixteen he got admitted into one of Europe`s most prestigious colleges at the University of London. He graduated with honors in Economics with Management at the top of his class and followed on achieving a Masters degree. After a couple of years at the London offices of J.P. Morgan, Raheem decided to go it alone starting a business in real estate.         

The business grew and grew under Raheem`s hard work and leadership. By 2017, his company, Blacksands Pacific had expanded into oil and gas and was one of the most successful black owned businesses in the world, and only one of three black owned oil and gas corporation in the United States. 

But two federal judges did not want a black man to be so successful and they set out to destroy Raheem. This is our story of racial discrimination at the highest levels which resulted in the imprisonment of an innocent black man, Raheem Brennerman. 

In 2017, Raheem`s company, Blacksands Pacific had a simple contract dispute with a Chinese bank, ICBC in front of Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of the Southern District of New York. Raheem was specifically excluded from the civil litigation. It was a simple civil dispute between two companies, one U.S. and one Chinese. 

Judge Kaplan realizing that Raheem was black conducted illegal extra judicial research by Googling him. We found this out at Raheem`s bail hearing when the Chief Judge of the Southern District of New York asked her clerk who told her about the internet print-out from the judge. The clerk said "the research came from Judge Kaplan". An astonishing admission of wrongdoing by a senior federal judge. 

Following on, Judge Kaplan held Raheem in contempt of court for not providing ICBC some documents. But ICBC now did not want these documents because Blacksands Pacific and ICBC were in the middle of negotiating a settlement. Judge Kaplan intervened. 

Even though the Judge never asked Raheem to do anything in his personal capacity, he saw through Blacksands Pacific the company and held Raheem in contempt of court. This was a serious federal charge for which Raheem was sentenced to twenty-four months in jail. 

We say the illegal research, Raheem`s lack of personal responsibility and the judge ignoring the law and the illegal piercing of the corporate veil were all directed at Raheem because he is a successful black businessman. 

But Judge Kaplan had not yet finished persecuting Raheem. Just weeks after Raheem was granted bail for the contempt of court charge, Manhattan federal prosecutors, led by Emil J. Bove III* flew to Las Vegas and arrested Raheem on bank fraud charges. Judge Kaplan had prepared the arrest warrant for the prosecution even though, as we found out the prosecutors thought an arrest was unnecessary. We do not know of another situation like this, but it makes sense as Raheem is a successful black man. 

The bank fraud case was then taken up by a new judge - Judge Richard J. Sullivan because it was a new case. The allegation this time was that Raheem had defrauded several financial institutions out of tens and hundreds of millions of dollars. Judge Sullivan then took over the persecution of Raheem.

There were two alleged frauds both of which Judge Sullivan helped the prosecutors to persecute Raheem. The first alleged fraud was against the Chinese bank, ICBC, that Raheem made false statements to ICBC to obtain a multi-million dollar business loan. ICBC however had prepared a file before making the business loan, a critical piece of evidence on whether Raheem had or had not made the alleged false statements. The file was held in London and had been prepared by a Julian Madgett, the only witness from the Chinese bank. Madgett testified in court that the file existed so Raheem asked for a copy of it but Judge Sullivan denied Raheem`s request for the evidence that would have clearly proved Raheem`s innocence. 

The second alleged fraud was against Morgan Stanley, that Raheem had opened a new account intending to defraud them of $6,000 of banking perks (sky miles, a fancy charge card and preferential interest rates on deposits). For a bank fraud charge, the law requires the victim to be a federally insured bank, or FDIC for short. The problem for Judge Sullivan was that the bank that Raheem had opened the account with, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC was NOT an FDIC insured bank. It was in fact a wealth management brokerage account nothing like a bank you and I see on the street. 

This did not matter to Judge Sullivan, he had to find a way of finding Raheem guilty. So he said that because another part of Morgan Stanley was FDIC insured, then Raheem was guilty. Judge Sullivan in open Court said that the bank fraud was to "defraud the private banking arm of Morgan Stanley", but documents presented to the jury clearly showed that his account was opened at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC which is not an insured bank - no bank, no bank fraud 

Judge Sullivan did not allow Raheem the critical piece of evidence, the file in London to prove his innocence and falsely stated another FDIC insured arm of Morgan Stanley instead of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC which is not a bank. 

Raheem unable to prove his innocence through two serious illegal actions by Judge Sullivan because he is a successful black businessman, was sentenced to over a decade in jail. 

Raheem has been languishing in prison for more than three years fighting to correct the serious wrongs inflicted on him by these two senior federal judges. Raheem has suffered mightily because of the color of his skin and his hard earn success. Prison has not been kind to Raheem either. While in prison Raheem caught Covid-19 in December 2020 from which he suffered terribly - he got Covid pneumonia, had severe breathing problems, a high temperature and suffered violent coughs. The prison didn't provide any treatment to Raheem who suffers from serious diabetes and high blood pressure. Raheem`s mother also passed away in 2019 because of his imprisonment.

-----------------------------

This story commenced in 2013, when ICBC (London) plc ("ICBC London") and The Blacksands Pacific Group, Inc., ("Blacksands"), negotiated US$1.35 Billion finance facility intended for the acquisition of oil and gas assets. Specifically US$600 million was to be used to acquire the Cat Canyon oilfield in California while the remaining, US$750 million was to be used to acquire 30% of a ConocoPhillips Nigeria asset jointly with another Nigeria based oil and gas corporation. After nine months of negotiations and having incurred and disbursed approximately US$11.25 million to satisfy the finance conditions stipulated by ICBC London, the finance failed to materialize and Blacksands decided to proceed with another financial institution. A Hong Kong based financial institution procured both the senior debt finance jointly with a secured second lien high-yield finance and Blacksands was ready to terminate its relationship with ICBC London.

The then Deputy CEO of ICBC London, Mr. Bo Jiang and one of its employee, Mr. Julian Madgett invited Mr. Brennerman to their office in London, U.K. and persuaded Blacksands to retain ICBC London on the transaction. ICBC London offered Blacksands a US$20 million bridge finance which would roll into a US$70 million revolver credit facility to rank alongside the overall finance procured by the Hong Kong based financial institution (hence the bridge finance transaction which became the subject of the prosecution was not intended to be immediately repaid by Blacksands). The US$20 million bridge finance was intended for Blacksands to finance costs it had incurred in satisfying the finance conditions stipulated by ICBC London mainly because ICBC London had reneged on providing the larger finance. Of the US$20 million bridge finance, Blacksands drew-down US$5 million to replace part of the funds which it had already disbursed. ICBC London deducted US$600,000 from the US$5 million to pay its fees and legal costs and Blacksands received the net amount of US$4.4 million. 

By 2014, when ICBC London was required to roll the bridge finance into the revolver credit facility, ICBC London once again reneged on the arrangement and Blacksands, while continuing to pay the interest on the bridge finance, decided to withhold repayment of the principal amount of US$5 million until it had completed all its financing. ICBC London then sued Blacksands in New York Supreme Court and counsel for Blacksands removed the cause to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York under the caption, ICBC (London) PLC v. The Blacksands Pacific Group, Inc., and the case (No. 15-cv-0070-LAK) was assigned to U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan ("Judge Kaplan")

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Raheem Brennerman grew up between New York city and London. By studying hard at the tender young age of sixteen, he got admitted into one of Europe`s most prestigious colleges at the University of London. He graduated with honors in Economics at the top of his class and followed on achieving a Masters degree. After a couple of years at the London offices of J.P. Morgan, Raheem decided to go it alone starting a business in real estate. 

The business grew and grew under Raheem`s hard work and leadership. By 2017, his company, Blacksands Pacific had expanded into oil and gas and was one of the most successful black owned businesses in the world, only one of three black owned oil and gas corporation in the United States. 

But two federal judges did not want a black man to be so successful and they set out to destroy Raheem. This is our story of racial discrimination at the highest levels which resulted in the imprisonment of an innocent black man, Raheem Brennerman.

In 2017, Raheem`s company, Blacksands Pacific had a simple contract dispute with a Chinese bank, ICBC in front of Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of the Southern District of New York. Raheem was specifically excluded from the civil litigation. It was a simple civil dispute between two companies, one U.S. and one Chinese. 

Judge Kaplan realizing that Raheem was black conducted illegal extra judicial research by Googling him. We found this out at Raheem`s bail hearing when the Chief Judge of the Southern District of New York asked her clerk who told her about the internet print-out from Judge Kaplan. The clerk said "the research came from Judge Kaplan". An astonishing admission of wrongdoing by a senior federal judge. 

Following on, Judge Kaplan held Raheem in contempt of court for not providing ICBC some documents. But ICBC now did not want these documents because Blacksands Pacific and ICBC were in the middle of negotiating a settlement. Judge Kaplan intervened. 

Even though the Judge never asked Raheem to do anything in his personal capacity, he saw through Blacksands Pacific the company and held Raheem in contempt of court. This was a serious federal charge for which Raheem was sentenced to twenty-four months in jail.

We say the illegal search, Raheem`s lack of personal responsibility, the judge ignoring the law and the illegal piercing of the corporate veil were all directed at Raheem because he is a successful black businessman.

But Judge Kaplan had not yet finished persecuting Raheem. Just weeks after Raheem was granted bail for the contempt of court charge, Manhattan federal prosecutors, led by Emil J. Bove III* flew to Las Vegas and arrested Raheem on bank fraud charges. Judge Kaplan had prepared the arrest warrant for the prosecution even though, as we found out the prosecutors thought an arrest was unnecessary. We do not know of another situation like this, but it makes sense as Raheem is a successful black man. 

The bank fraud case was then taken up by a new Judge - Judge Richard J. Sullivan because it was a new case. The allegation this time was that Raheem had defrauded several financial institutions out of tens and hundreds of millions of dollars. Judge Sullivan then took over the persecution of Raheem. 

There were two alleged frauds both of which Judge Sullivan helped the prosecutors to persecute Raheem. The first alleged fraud against the Chinese bank, ICBC, that Raheem made false statements to ICBC to obtain a multi-million dollar business loan. ICBC however had prepared a file before making the business loan, a critical piece of evidence on whether Raheem had or had not made the alleged false statements. The file was held in London and had been prepared by a Julian Madgett, the only witness from the Chinese bank. Madgett testified in court that the file existed so Raheem asked for a copy of it but Judge Sullivan denied Raheem`s request for the evidence that would have clearly proved Raheem`s innocence.

The second alleged fraud was against Morgan Stanley, that Raheem had opened a new account intending to defraud them of $6,000 of banking perks (sky miles, a fancy credit card and preferential interest rates on deposits). For a bank fraud charge the law requires the victim to be a federally insured bank, or FDIC for short. The problem for Judge Sullivan was that the bank that Raheem had opened the account with, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC was NOT an FDIC insured bank. It was in fact a wealth management brokerage account nothing like a bank you and I see on the street. 

This did not matter to Judge Sullivan, he had to find a way of finding Raheem guilty. So he said that because another part of Morgan Stanley was FDIC insured then Raheem was guilty. Judge Sullivan in open Court said that the bank fraud was to "defraud the private banking arm of Morgan Stanley", but documents presented to the jury clearly showed that his account was opened at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC which is not an insured bank - no bank, no bank fraud. 

Judge Sullivan did not allow Raheem the critical piece of evidence, the file in London to prove his innocence and falsely stated another FDIC insured arm of Morgan Stanley instead of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC which is not a bank. 

Raheem, unable to prove his innocence through two serious illegal actions by Judge Sullivan because he is a successful black businessman, was sentence to one hundred and forty-four months in jail. 

Raheem has placed on Court records many evidence describing their lies to Judge Kaplan and Sullivan, as well as the Manhattan federal appeals court, but as of today not surprisingly they have ignored him. 

Without anywhere to turn, Raheem has now been languishing in prison for more than three years fighting to correct the serious wrongs inflicted on him by these two senior federal judges. Raheem has suffered mightily because of the color of his skin and his hard earned success. Prison has not been kind to Raheem either. While in prison Raheem caught Covid-19 in December 2020 from which he suffered terribly - he got Covid pneumonia, had severe breathing problems, a high temperature and suffered violent coughs. The prison didn't provide any treatment to Raheem who suffers from chronic diabetes and high blood pressure. Raheem`s mother also passed away in 2019 because of his imprisonment. 

Don't let the persecution of an innocent black man continue....

-------------------------------------------------

This story commenced in 2013, when ICBC (London) plc ("ICBC London") and The Blacksands Pacific Group, Inc., ("Blacksands"), negotiated US$1.35 Billion finance facility intended for the acquisition of oil and gas assets. Specifically US$600 million was to be used to acquire the Cat Canyon oilfield in California while the remaining, US$750 million was to be used to acquire 30% of a ConocoPhillips Nigeria asset jointly with another Nigeria based oil and gas corporation. After nine months of negotiations and having incurred and disbursed approximately US$11.25 million to satisfy the finance conditions stipulated by ICBC London, the finance failed to materialize and Blacksands decided to proceed with another financial institution. A Hong Kong based financial institution procured both the senior debt finance jointly with a secured second lien high-yield finance and Blacksands was ready to terminate its relationship with ICBC London. 

The then Deputy CEO of ICBC London, Mr. Bo Jiang and one of its employee, Mr. Julian Madgett invited Mr. Brennerman to their office in London, U.K. and persuaded Blacksands to retain ICBC London on the transaction. ICBC London offered Blacksands a US$20 million bridge finance which would roll into a US$70 million revolver credit facility to rank alongside the overall finance procured by the Hong Kong based financial institution (hence the bridge finance transaction which became the subject of the prosecution was not intended to be immediately repaid by Blacksands). The US$20 million bridge finance was intended for Blacksands to finance costs it had incurred in satisfying the finance conditions stipulated by ICBC London mainly because ICBC London had reneged on providing the larger finance. Of the US$20 million bridge finance. Blacksands drew-down US$5 million to replace part of the funds which it had already disbursed. ICBC London deducted US$600,000 from the US$5 million to pay its fees and legal costs and Blacksands received the net amount of US$4.4 million. 

By 2014, when ICBC London was required to roll the bridge finance into the revolver credit facility, ICBC London once again reneged on the arrangement and Blacksands, while continuing to pay the interest on the bridge finance, decided to withhold repayment of the principal amount of US$5 million until it had completed all its financing. ICBC London then sued Blacksands in New York Supreme Court and counsel for Blacksands removed the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York under the caption, ICBC (London) PLC v. The Blacksands Pacific Group, Inc., and the case (No. 15-cv-0070-LAK) was assigned to U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan ("Judge Kaplan")

Good Morning Denis:

Below is a summary of amendments/updates to the LEGAL HEADLINES (Page) of the new site. 

These amendments will make it more succinct and clear for readers. 

======================
LEGAL HEADLINES (Page):
======================

Within the immediate Section below (Replace existing text with the below):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                       Brother Raheem Jefferson Brennerman is a black 
                     man who was prosecuted and imprisoned for crime 
                                           he did not commit

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        THIS IS A PERSECUTION (NOT A PROSECUTION) 

THE LEGAL STORY:

Raheem Jefferson Brennerman was prosecuted on two separate charges, and tried in front of two separate judges all in 2017. Raheem went to prison in 2019 from federal detention.

1.) JUDGE KAPLAN TRIED RAHEEM FOR THE CHARGE OF CRIMINAL CONTEMPT OF COURT. 

Judge Kaplan broke two federal rule in targeting Raheem. 

First, Judge Kaplan broke federal rule by Googling Raheem so as to target him. 

Second, Judge Kaplan broke the law in "OSRecovery, Inc., v. One Groupe Int`l, Inc., 462 F.3d 87, 90 (2006)" to charge Raheem even though Raheem was not a party to the underlying civil case. 

Judge Kaplan ignored the rule and ethics to preside over this case, even though he asked the federal prosecutors to charge Raheem. By doing so, Judge Kaplan acted as the judge, the jury and the executioner. 

Judge Kaplan sentenced Raheem to 24 months in jail for a crime he did not commit. 

Raheem did not commit this crime. Raheem should not be in prison for this crime. 

2.) JUDGE SULLIVAN TRIED RAHEEM FOR CHARGES OF BANK AND WIRE FRAUD.

Judge Sullivan carried out two separate pieces of judicial misconduct in targeting Raheem. 

First, under the charge of bank fraud, Judge Sullivan misrepresented that Raheem banked with a FDIC-insured bank (Morgan Stanley Private Bank). Yet there was NO evidence of this, in fact the evidence presented was that Raheen banked with a non-bank, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC. There was no bank fraud. 

Manhattan prosecutors argued that bank fraud occurred based on an account Raheem opened for a few weeks with an institution, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC which is not a bank. 

The prosecutors pivoted and presented that Raheem banked with Morgan Stanley Private Bank. Judge Sullivan argued that Raheem banked with the Morgan Stanley Private bank and that he received "perks" worth $6,000 such as sky miles and fancy credit card. But Raheem did not bank with Morgan Stanley Private Bank. Even with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC, where he banked, the credit card was closed with zero balance and Raheem did not have the account open long enough to even earn any sky miles. 

The law says that prosecutors cannot prosecute bank fraud unless the account is with an institution which is FDIC insured, however Judge Sullivan and prosecutors ignored the law. In fact, when Raheem highlighted evidence to the judge he just ignored him.  

Second, Judge Sullivan refused to allow Raheem access to the key piece of evidence (ICBC underwriting file) which would have proven Raheem`s innocence. The judge allowed government witness, Julian Madgett to testify to the existence of the file yet refused Raheem`s multiple pleas to obtain the file. 

Judge Sullivan sentenced Raheem to several years in jail for crimes he did not commit. 

Raheem did not commit these crimes. Raheem should not be in prison for these crimes. 

Judge Sullivan carried out gross judicial misconduct over this case. 

ASK MANHATTAN FEDERAL PROSECUTORS AND FEDERAL COURT (JUDGE KAPLAN AND JUDGE SULLIVAN) TO SHOW US THE EVIDENCE - THE ICBC UNDERWRITING FILES, IF THEY TRULY BELIEVE FRAUD OR CONTEMPT OCCURRED. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                         THE COURT (JUDGE RICHARD J. SULLIVAN) AND THE 
                        MANHATTAN PROSECUTORS MISREPRESENTED FACTS

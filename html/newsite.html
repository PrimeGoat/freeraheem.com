				<h2>OUR STORY</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="subSection justify bold">
				<p>Raheem Brennerman grew up between New York city and London. By studying hard at the tender young age of sixteen he got admitted into one of Europe`s most prestigious colleges at the University of London. He graduated with honors in Economics with Management at the top of his class and followed on achieving a Masters degree. After a couple of years at the London offices of J.P. Morgan, Raheem decided to go it alone starting a business in real estate.</p>
				<p>The business grew and grew under Raheem`s hard work and leadership. By 2017, his company, Blacksands Pacific had expanded into oil and gas and was one of the most successful black owned businesses in the world, and only one of three black owned oil and gas corporation in the United States.</p>
				<p>But two federal judges did not want a black man to be so successful and they set out to destroy Raheem. This is our story of racial discrimination at the highest levels which resulted in the imprisonment of an innocent black man, Raheem Brennerman.</p>
				<p>In 2017, Raheem`s company, Blacksands Pacific had a simple contract dispute with a Chinese bank, ICBC in front of Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of the Southern District of New York. Raheem was specifically excluded from the civil litigation. It was a simple civil dispute between two companies, one U.S. and one Chinese.</p>
				<p>Judge Kaplan realizing that Raheem was black conducted illegal extra judicial research by Googling him. We found this out at Raheem`s bail hearing when the Chief Judge of the Southern District of New York asked her clerk who told her about the internet print-out from the judge. The clerk said "the research came from Judge Kaplan". An astonishing admission of wrongdoing by a senior federal judge.</p>
				<p>Following on, Judge Kaplan held Raheem in contempt of court for not providing ICBC some documents. But ICBC now did not want these documents because Blacksands Pacific and ICBC were in the middle of negotiating a settlement. Judge Kaplan intervened.</p>
				<p>Even though the Judge never asked Raheem to do anything in his personal capacity, he saw through Blacksands Pacific the company and held Raheem in contempt of court. This was a serious federal charge for which Raheem was sentenced to twenty-four months in jail.</p>
				<p>We say the illegal research, Raheem`s lack of personal responsibility and the judge ignoring the law and the illegal piercing of the corporate veil were all directed at Raheem because he is a successful black businessman.</p>
				<p>But Judge Kaplan had not yet finished persecuting Raheem. Just weeks after Raheem was granted bail for the contempt of court charge, Manhattan federal prosecutors, led by Emil J. Bove III* flew to Las Vegas and arrested Raheem on bank fraud charges. Judge Kaplan had prepared the arrest warrant for the prosecution even though, as we found out the prosecutors thought an arrest was unnecessary. We do not know of another situation like this, but it makes sense as Raheem is a successful black man.</p>
				<p>The bank fraud case was then taken up by a new judge - Judge Richard J. Sullivan because it was a new case. The allegation this time was that Raheem had defrauded several financial institutions out of tens and hundreds of millions of dollars. Judge Sullivan then took over the persecution of Raheem.</p>
				<p>There were two alleged frauds both of which Judge Sullivan helped the prosecutors to persecute Raheem. The first alleged fraud was against the Chinese bank, ICBC, that Raheem made false statements to ICBC to obtain a multi-million dollar business loan. ICBC however had prepared a file before making the business loan, a critical piece of evidence on whether Raheem had or had not made the alleged false statements. The file was held in London and had been prepared by a Julian Madgett, the only witness from the Chinese bank. Madgett testified in court that the file existed so Raheem asked for a copy of it but Judge Sullivan denied Raheem`s request for the evidence that would have clearly proved Raheem`s innocence.</p>
				<p>The second alleged fraud was against Morgan Stanley, that Raheem had opened a new account intending to defraud them of $6,000 of banking perks (sky miles, a fancy charge card and preferential interest rates on deposits). For a bank fraud charge, the law requires the victim to be a federally insured bank, or FDIC for short. The problem for Judge Sullivan was that the bank that Raheem had opened the account with, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC was NOT an FDIC insured bank. It was in fact a wealth management brokerage account nothing like a bank you and I see on the street.</p>
				<p>This did not matter to Judge Sullivan, he had to find a way of finding Raheem guilty. So he said that because another part of Morgan Stanley was FDIC insured, then Raheem was guilty. Judge Sullivan in open Court said that the bank fraud was to "defraud the private banking arm of Morgan Stanley", but documents presented to the jury clearly showed that his account was opened at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC which is not an insured bank - no bank, no bank fraud</p>
				<p>Judge Sullivan did not allow Raheem the critical piece of evidence, the file in London to prove his innocence and falsely stated another FDIC insured arm of Morgan Stanley instead of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC which is not a bank.</p>
				<p>Raheem unable to prove his innocence through two serious illegal actions by Judge Sullivan because he is a successful black businessman, was sentenced to over a decade in jail.</p>
				<p>Raheem has been languishing in prison for more than three years fighting to correct the serious wrongs inflicted on him by these two senior federal judges. Raheem has suffered mightily because of the color of his skin and his hard earn success. Prison has not been kind to Raheem either. While in prison Raheem caught Covid-19 in December 2020 from which he suffered terribly - he got Covid pneumonia, had severe breathing problems, a high temperature and suffered violent coughs. The prison didn't provide any treatment to Raheem who suffers from serious diabetes and high blood pressure. Raheem`s mother also passed away in 2019 because of his imprisonment.</p>
				<p>Don't let the persecution of an innocent black man continue....Support Raheem by signing our Petition.</p>

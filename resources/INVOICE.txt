I have condensed this work into a flat rate of $500, as a token of support. This specific work has been my profession for over a decade, so it was easy and straightforward. The more difficult work was the Free Raheem website. That is the bulk of the work being invoiced. I have thoroughly accounted for the various aspects of this work and have included historic rates, so that you'll be charged less for earlier years, when the work didn't cost as much as it does with today's rates.

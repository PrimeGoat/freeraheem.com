In 2013, a Chinese bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China - ICBC agreed $1.35 Billion oil and gas financing with Blacksands Pacific. When ICBC reneged on the agreement after Blacksands Pacific had spent in-excess of $11 million to satisfy the financing conditions, ICBC agreed to provide Blacksands Pacific with a $20 million bridge loan finance with the agreement to roll it into a $70 million revolver credit facility. <ref name=":4">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=7 July 2020|title=The court and the Manhattan Prosecutors misrepresented facts and evidence then ignored the law to wrongly convict an innocent black man|url=https://www.freeraheem.com/legal.html#misrepresented|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=Free Raheem J Brennerman}}</ref><ref name="freeraheem">{{Cite web|title=Free Raheem Brennerman|url=https://www.freeraheem.com/|website=Free Raheem J Brennerman}}</ref> Blacksands Pacific withdrew $5 million from the $20 million to cover expenses it had already incurred. ICBC ultimately reneged again on rolling the bridge finance into a revolver credit facility. Blacksands Pacific refused to repay the $5 million arguing that ICBC caused it to incur expenses, when it had no intention of complying with the agreement. ICBC sued Blacksands Pacific in New York State Supreme Court however Blacksands Pacific attorneys removed the case to U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and the case was assigned to Judge Lewis A. Kaplan. <ref name=":4" /><ref name="freeraheem" />

Although the civil case had been ongoing since 2014, in 2016 Judge Kaplan ignored the federal rule to conduct extra judicial research into Brennerman by Googling him. Judge Kaplan also ignored the law which states that a party not involved with the civil case cannot be held in contempt and he illegally pierced through the corporate veil of Blacksands Pacific and held Brennerman, the Chairman and CEO in contempt even though Brennerman was not involved in the civil case between ICBC and Blacksands Pacific and Judge Kaplan never directed him personally to do anything. There was no motion to compel or subpoena issued for him to do anything. <ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterpavlo/2018/05/29/businessman-convicted-in-two-criminal-cases-has-new-legal-representation-himself/1#19a8797b1559|title=Businessman Convicted In Two Criminal Cases Has New Legal Representation, Himself|date=May 29, 2018|website=Forbes}}</ref>

Following the erroneously adjudged contempt against Brennerman, on April 19, 2017 at the insistence and behest of Judge Kaplan, the prosecutors from the United States Attorney Office for the Southern District of New York flew from New York to Las Vegas to arrest Brennerman for criminal contempt of court based on arrest warrant prepared, signed and enforced at the insistence of Judge Kaplan, even though there was no pending charge(s) against Brennerman. <ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4" /><ref name="freeraheem" /> He was granted bail by Chief Judge Colleen McMahon of the Southern District of New York. Thereafter, on May 31, 2017, the same prosecutors indicted Brennerman without any prior investigation on fraud charges based on the same civil case between ICBC and Blacksands Pacific which had been ongoing for a few years. The case was assigned to Judge Richard J. Sullivan. The prosecutors indicted Brennerman without ever obtaining or reviewing the pertinent transaction files from ICBC. The next day, on June 1, 2017, the federal prosecutors disseminated online under the headline - Chairman and CEO of purported Oil and Gas Company charged in Manhattan Federal Court with $300 million International Fraud Scheme.<ref name=":2" /><ref name="ceo-charged">{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/chairman-and-ceo-purported-oil-and-gas-company-charged-manhattan-federal-court-300|title=Chairman And CEO Of Purported Oil And Gas Company Charged In Manhattan Federal Court With $300 Million International Fraud Scheme|date=June 1, 2017|website=United States Department of Justice}}</ref>

Prior to trial, Brennerman through his attorneys at Thompson Hine LLP repeatedly requested for the pertinent ICBC transaction files to show that he is innocent of the charges, however both Judge Kaplan and Judge Sullivan separately denied his request and refused to provide him the evidence. <ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4" /><ref name="freeraheem" /> During trial when the prosecution witness, Julian Madgett from ICBC testified that evidence exist with the bank in their London office, which documents the basis for the bank approving the transaction and thus will clearly show whether Brennerman made misrepresentation to commit fraud or not. This evidence was important since the prosecutors never requested, obtained or reviewed it prior to indicting Brennerman for fraud, however when Brennerman again made request to Judge Sullivan for the evidence to use for his defense and to confront the witness against him, Judge Sullivan denied his request while stating on record that Julian Madgett had testified that the evidence - ICBC files are with the bank`s file in London, United Kingdom. This was despite the fact that ICBC had already provide over 6,000 pages of email communication between ICBC and Blacksands Pacific from London, United Kingdom while omitting the most important documents - the transaction underwriting files which would have conclusively demonstrated if any fraud occurred. <ref name=":4" /><ref name="freeraheem" />

According to court filings, to distract from the fact that there was/is no evidence to support the fraud allegations and in an endeavor to promote false narrative, both Judge Sullivan and the federal prosecutors pivoted to disseminate falsehoods and promote xenophobia and stereotype. Even though the federal prosecutors were in possession of Brennerman`s birth certificate, passports and Government issued identification documents from United Kingdom, United States and Switzerland, they disseminated that Brennerman would abscond to Nigeria, a country where Brennerman is neither a citizen or resident. This was disseminated to promote xenophobia and stereotype about Nigeria given their fraud allegations. During trial, the federal prosecutors intentionally withheld Brennerman`s birth certificate from the jury. <ref name=":4" /><ref name="freeraheem" /> The evidence would have clearly refuted the false stereotype and proven Brennerman`s name and nationality. 

The falsehood, xenophobia and stereotype was also promoted after trial on December 10, 2017, when the Sunday Times of London disseminated online two contemporaneous articles with one headlined - Fraudster, Raheem Brennerman faces 90 years in jail. <ref name="fraudster-raheem">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/fraudster-raheem-brennerman-faces-90-years-in-jail-x7glhj9hh|title=Fraudster Raheem Brennerman faces 90 years in jail|date=December 10, 2017|website=The Times UK}}</ref>

In May 2018, following investigation into the criminal cases, Forbes released a publication headlined - Businessman convicted in two criminal cases has new legal representation, himself, where Forbes highlighted the issues with the two criminal cases, first that Brennerman was prosecuted and convicted for criminal contempt of court for court orders that were never directed at him but at Blacksands Pacific, the company. That Judge Kaplan insisted on the prosecutors arresting Brennerman, even while the prosecutors pleaded with the judge against such arrest. The Forbes article highlighted that the bank fraud focused on the wealth management account which Brennerman opened in January 2013 in Beverly Hills, California at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC which is not a bank and not FDIC insured. Further that the bank fraud charge and conviction was not about $300 million of financing but that Brennerman received $6,500 in banking perks. The article further highlighted that the fraud case focused on the $5 million bridge finance provided to Blacksands Pacific by ICBC following negotiations for a $600 million - $750 million credit line. It highlighted that the $5 million bridge finance was to reimburse Blacksands Pacific, given that the company had extended more than twice that amount in satisfying the finance conditions of ICBC and that Brennerman was as of May 2018, after the trial, attempting to obtain the complete records including the lending and underwriting files from ICBC which were never presented at trial and which would have demonstrated his innocence. <ref name=":2" />

In November 2018, Forbes released a further publication headlined - Businessman Raheem Brennerman denied evidence to prove innocence, vows to fight on, where Forbes highlighted that the sentence imposed by Judge Sullivan on November 19, 2018 was harsh considering that Brennerman`s conviction was for $5 million bridge finance transaction and that there was no evidence of $300 million international fraud throughout his trial. Also that Brennerman had been denied evidence at trial which he required to defend himself and confront witness against him. The publication also highlighted that Brennerman was sentenced on civil contempt charges involving the transaction between ICBC and Blacksands Pacific, a case in which Brennerman was not even personally involved. <ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterpavlo/2018/11/30/businessman-raheem-brennerman-denied-evidence-to-prove-innocence-vows-to-fight-on/#51e103ae7bb8|title=Businessman Raheem Brennerman Denied Evidence To Prove Innocence, Vows To Fight On|last=Pavlo|first=Walter|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-12-03|language=en}}</ref>

In June 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected Brennerman`s challenge to his convictions. On November 23, 2020 and again on December 29, 2020, Brennerman filed further papers with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit addressed to Chief Judge Debra Ann Livingston challenging his conviction and highlighting with demonstrable evidence that the Second Circuit Appeals Court panel misrepresented material facts, evidence and record as to the fraud conviction and created disparity with the Court`s prior instructions as to the contempt convictions.<ref name="correspondence">{{Cite web|url=https://www.freeraheem.com/legal.html#complaint|title=Correspondence submitted to Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to highlight misrepresentation of material facts, evidence and record by the Appellate panel Court|date=November 21, 2020|website=Free Raheem J Brennerman}}</ref>

In February 2021, further demonstrable evidence was presented to the Court highlighting that Judge Richard J. Sullivan fabricated and distorted evidence to convict and sentence Brennerman for bank fraud, while also intentionally depriving Brennerman access to evidence which would demonstrate his innocence of the other fraud charges. <ref name=":4" /><ref name="freeraheem" /> The court filings highlight that the entire prosecution was fabricated by Judge Kaplan, Judge Sullivan and the federal prosecutors. When they lacked evidence Judge Sullivan fabricated and distorted it. Judge Kaplan ignored the law to convict Brennerman and the federal prosecutors were pressured by the judges to falsely prosecute Brennerman. They intentionally disseminated falsehoods about Brennerman`s name, nationality and educational background in an endeavor to cause reputational damage and distract from the racial injustice with the wrongful prosecution and false imprisonment. <ref name=":4" /><ref name="freeraheem" />

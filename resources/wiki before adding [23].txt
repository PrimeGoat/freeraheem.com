== Life ==

Brennerman was born in 1978 and grew up between New York city, London and Switzerland. Brennerman was born to an American father who was a businessman and primarily raised by his mother, who was an international businesswoman, a diamond broker and textile trader. His step-father, an American banker and businessman of Nigerian descent also partly raised him and initially introduced him to oil & gas on the African continent. <ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://www.leadersmag.com/issues/2014.4_Oct/ROB/LEADERS-Raheem-Brennerman-Blacksands-Pacific-Group-BLV-Group.html|title=Building Multi-Generation Businesses|publisher=LEADERS magazine|accessdate=31 October 2014}}</ref> Brennerman attended elite private schools and by studying hard at the tender young age of sixteen he was admitted into one of Europe's most prestigious colleges at the University of London. He graduated with honors in Economics at the top of his class and followed on achieving a Masters degree from an Ivy league University in New York. <ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewhoswhoreleases.com/press-release/raheem-brennerman-inducted-into-worldwide-whos-who-for-excellence-in-oil-and-ga|title=Raheem Brennerman Inducted into Worldwide Who's Who for Excellence in Oil and Gas Operations|publisher=Worldwide Who's Who|accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref> He started his career in Investment Banking at J. P. Morgan Chase & Co with focus on mergers and acquisition in the U.S. and European markets.<ref name=":0" />

After a couple of years at J. P. Morgan Chase & Co in 2001 at the age of twenty-three and prior to starting his own businesses - Blacksands Pacific and BLV Group, Brennerman briefly worked for the family energy business in Louisiana started by his paternal grandfather and run by his father and brother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blacksandspacific.com/pages/founder-chairman-profile.html|title=Founder's Profile|publisher=Blacksands Pacific|accessdate=8 October 2014}}</ref> He also managed the family-owned real estate businesses established by his maternal grandparents, with investments in the United States and Europe. 

Brennerman is an avid supporter of education, sponsoring aspiring and talented young students. He is also an activist fighting for equal protection and civil rights. Through his non-profit endeavors among other things, he has sponsored students from other parts of the world to the United States to further their education. 

As a young man, Brennerman adopted his step-father's name for eight years and in 2002, he legally changed his name back to his birth name, Raheem Jefferson Brennerman. In 2012, the United Kingdom passport agency incorrectly issued him a renewal passport in the incorrect order of forenames, Jefferson Raheem Brennerman instead of Raheem Jefferson Brennerman.

== Legal ==

On April 19, 2017, the United States Attorney Office, Southern District of New York, flew from New York to Las Vegas to arrest Brenneman for criminal contempt of court for court orders that were directed at Blacksands Pacific and not at Brennerman himself. Then, on May 31, 2017, the United States Attorney Office, Southern District of New York, then indicted Brennerman on four counts of fraud, conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, bank fraud, wire fraud, and visa fraud. On June 1, 2017, the United States Attorney Office for the Southern District of New York disseminated online under the headline - Chairman and CEO of Purported Oil and Gas Company charged in Manhattan Federal Court with $300 million International Fraud Scheme.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterpavlo/2018/05/29/businessman-convicted-in-two-criminal-cases-has-new-legal-representation-himself/1#19a8797b1559|title=Businessman Convicted In Two Criminal Cases Has New Legal Representation, Himself|date=May 29, 2018|website=Forbes}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/chairman-and-ceo-purported-oil-and-gas-company-charged-manhattan-federal-court-300|title=Chairman And CEO Of Purported Oil And Gas Company Charged In Manhattan Federal Court With $300 Million International Fraud Scheme|date=June 1, 2017|website=United States Department of Justice}}</ref>

On November 26, 2017 jury selection commenced in the fraud case. On December 6, 2017, he was found guilty of conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, bank fraud, wire fraud and visa fraud in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York. His lawyer has stated he intends to appeal.<ref name=":2" /> Sentencing was scheduled for March 9, 2018. Thereafter on December 10, 2017, the Sunday Times of London disseminated online two contemporaneous articles with one headlined - Fraudster, Raheem Brennerman faces 90 years in jail. �<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/fraudster-raheem-brennerman-faces-90-years-in-jail-x7glhj9hh|title=Fraudster Raheem Brennerman faces 90 years in jail|date=December 10, 2017|website=The Times UK}}</ref>

On May 29, 2018, following an investigation into the criminal cases, Forbes released a publication headlined - Businessman convicted in two criminal cases has new legal representation, himself, where Forbes highlighted the issues with the two criminal cases, first that Brennerman was prosecuted and convicted for criminal contempt of court for court orders that were never directed at him but at Blacksands Pacific and that Judge Kaplan insisted on the prosecutors arresting Brennerman, even while the prosecutors pleaded with the judge against such arrest. The Forbes article highlighted that the bank fraud trial focused on the wealth management account which Brennerman opened in January 2013, with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, an entity which is not FDIC insured, and based in Beverly Hills, California. And on the $5 million bridge finance provided to Blacksands Pacific by ICBC (London) PLC following negotiations for a $600 million - $750 million credit line. Further, that the $5 million bridge finance, was to reimburse Blacksands Pacific, given that the company had extended more than twice that amount in satisfying the finance conditions of ICBC London and that Brennerman was as of May 2018, after the trials, attempting to obtain the complete records including the lending and underwriting files from ICBC (London) PLC which were never presented at trial and which would have demonstrated his innocence.<ref name=":2" />

On November 30, 2018, Forbes released a further publication headlined - Businessman Raheem Brennerman denied evidence to prove innocence, vows to fight on, where Forbes highlighted that the sentence imposed by Judge Sullivan on November 19, 2018, was harsh considering that Brennerman was convicted and sentenced for $5 million bridge finance transaction and that there was no evidence of the much larger, $300 million international fraud referenced throughout his trial. Also that Brennerman was sentenced on civil contempt charges involving the transaction between Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, ICBC (London) PLC and Blacksands Pacific, a case in which he was not even personally involved.<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterpavlo/2018/11/30/businessman-raheem-brennerman-denied-evidence-to-prove-innocence-vows-to-fight-on/#51e103ae7bb8|title=Businessman Raheem Brennerman Denied Evidence To Prove Innocence, Vows To Fight On|last=Pavlo|first=Walter|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-12-03|language=en}}</ref>

Forbes highlighted that Brennerman filed papers to challenge the conviction and his sentence. Further highlighting that Brennerman requested the records from ICBC (London) PLC based in London, U.K to demonstrate his innocence. That, in fact, Brennerman's court-ordered attorney asked Judge Sullivan to delay the sentencing date in order to obtain and present the ICBC London files but that request was denied. Those records have never been produced and Brennerman still believes that the information being held by ICBC could clear his name.<ref name=":3" />

In June 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected Brennerman`s challenge to his convictions. On November 23, 2020 and again on December 29, 2020, Brennerman filed further papers with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit addressed to Chief Judge Debra Ann Livingston challenging his conviction and highlighting that the Appeal`s Court panel misrepresented material facts, evidence and record as to the fraud conviction and created disparity with the Court`s prior instructions as to the contempt conviction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freeraheem.org/legal.html#complaint|title=Correspondence submitted to Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to highlight misrepresentation of material facts, evidence and record by the Appellate panel Court|date=November 21, 2020|website=Free Raheem J Brennerman}}</ref>

== Activism  ==
At the end of June 2020, Mr. Brennerman and other activist volunteers launched the campaign "FREE RAHEEM BRENNERMAN" and the website at [https://www.freeraheem.org/ www.freeraheem.org], which allege systemic oppression and racial injustice, and asserts that his was a wrongful prosecution that led to false imprisonment.  The campaign highlights that Manhattan Federal Court blatantly ignored the law, the record and evidence, and also highlights Judge Kaplan and Judge Sullivan's alleged errors, bias and violation of Brennerman`s Constitutional rights, among others.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=7 July 2020|title=The court and the Manhattan Prosecutors misrepresented facts and evidence then ignored the law to wrongly convict an innocent black man|url=https://www.freeraheem.org/legal.html#misrepresented|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=Free Raheem J Brennerman}}</ref> The campaign is reaching out to politicians, celebrities, influencers and advocates to stand with the campaign against racial injustice and in support of Raheem Brennerman and anyone else who has been affected by the alleged systemic oppression and racial injustice.

On September 20, 2020 a formal [https://www.freeraheem.org/resources/Complaint.pdf COMPLAINT] in furtherance of the complaint filed on behalf of Mr. Steven Donziger against SDNY District Court Judge Lewis A. Kaplan and extended to Second Circuit Court Judge Richard J. Sullivan was submitted to the Chief Judge of the Second Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals to highlight the pattern of Judicial Misconduct, Abuse of Power and Racial Injustice with the wrongful prosecution and false imprisonment of Raheem Jefferson Brennerman.  More details about Steven Donziger's own experience with Judge Kaplan's abuse of power have been provided [https://www.freeraheem.org/legal.html#abuse here].
